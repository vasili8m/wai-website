W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3 has several differences from Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to &lt;strong&gt;start by reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag3&quot;&gt;WCAG 3 Introduction&lt;/a&gt; first&lt;/strong&gt; to get important background on WCAG 3 development, review guidance, and timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WCAG 3 is intended to be easier to understand and more flexible than WCAG 2. The flexibility is to address different types of web content, apps, and tools — as well as organizations and people with disabilities. This WCAG 3 Draft proposes a different name, scope, structure, and draft conformance model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are seeking input from evaluators, developers, designers, project managers, policy makers, people with disabilities, and others — particularly on the structure and the draft conformance model. Additional review guidance is in the blog post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/blog/2021/01/wcag-3-fpwd/&quot;&gt;WCAG 3 FPWD Published&lt;/a&gt;.
