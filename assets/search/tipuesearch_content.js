W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3 has several differences from Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2. We encourage you to start by reading the WCAG 3 Introduction first to get important background on WCAG 3 development, review guidance, and timeline. WCAG 3 is intended to be easier to understand and more flexible than WCAG 2. The flexibility is to address different types of web content, apps, and tools — as well as organizations and people with disabilities. This WCAG 3 Draft proposes a different name, scope, structure, and draft conformance model. We are seeking input from evaluators, developers, designers, project managers, policy makers, people with disabilities, and others — particularly on the structure and the draft conformance model. Additional review guidance is in the blog post WCAG 3 FPWD Published. Please submit comments by 26 February 2021.",

    "title": "Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion",
    "text": "## Introduction {:.no-display} *Accessibility, usability, and inclusion* are closely related aspects in creating a web that works for everyone. Their goals, approaches, and guidelines overlap significantly. It is most effective to address them together when designing and developing websites and applications. There are a few situations when it's important to focus specifically on one aspect. For example, when developing standards and policies. Researching the accessibility needs of people with disabilities helps with developing those. This article briefly: - explains the distinctions and overlaps between accessibility, usability, and inclusive design, - encourages increased coordination across research and practice in these disciplines, and, - points out the importance of maintaining the focus of accessibility on people with disabilities. Distinctions and Overlaps {#terms} ------------------------- **Accessibility**: addresses discriminatory aspects related to equivalent user experience for people with disabilities. Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can equally perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools. It also means that they can contribute equally without barriers. For more information, see the [Accessibility introduction]({{ \"/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/\" | relative_url }}). **Usability**: is about designing products to be effective, efficient, and satisfying. Usability includes *user experience design*. This may include general aspects that impact everyone and do not disproportionally impact people with disabilities. Usability practice and research often does not sufficiently address the needs of people with disabilities. **Inclusion**: is about diversity, and ensuring involvement of everyone to the greatest extent possible. In some regions this is also referred to as *universal design* and *design for all*. It addresses a broad range of issues including: * accessibility for people with disabilities; * access to and quality of hardware, software, and Internet connectivity; * computer literacy and skills; * economic situation; * education; * geographic location; * culture; * age, including older and younger people; * and language. ### Accessibility and Usability {#accessible-usable} Accessibility primarily focuses on people with disabilities. Many accessibility requirements improve usability for everyone, especially in limiting situations. For example, providing sufficient contrast benefits people using the web on a mobile device in bright sunlight or in a dark room. Captions benefit people in noisy and in quiet environments. Some people have age-related functional limitations, and may not identify these as \"disability\". Accessibility addresses these situations too. Accessibility includes: - **Requirements that are technical and relate to the underlying code rather than to the visual appearance**. For example, they ensure that websites work well with assistive technologies. This includes screen readers that read aloud content, and screen magnifiers that enlarge content. Voice recognition software used to input text is another form of assistive technology. These aspects are typically not a focus of usability research and practice. - **Requirements that relate to user interaction and visual design**. Inadequate design can cause significant barriers for people with disabilities. That is why they are included. For example, understandable instructions and feedback for website forms and applications is good usability. They also help people with cognitive and learning disabilities. Without such requirements, some people with disabilities may be excluded from using the Web. There is a significant overlap between accessibility and usability. [ISO 9241-11](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16883), defines usability as: > The \"extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals effectively, efficiently and with satisfaction in a specified context of use\". This could address accessibility ***when***: * \"specified users\" includes people with a range of disabilities, and * \"specified context of use\" includes accessibility considerations such as assistive technologies. But usability practice and research often does not consider the needs of people with disabilities. ### Accessibility and Inclusion {#inclusive-design} Several accessibility requirements also benefit people and situations that are a focus of inclusive design. For example, [Web Accessibility Benefits People With and *Without* Disabilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/soc#groups) describes accessibility benefits for: - people with low literacy or not fluent in the language, - people with low bandwidth connections or using older technologies, - new and infrequent users, and, - [mobile device users]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag-mobile-overlap/\" | relative_url }}). However, accessibility focuses on disability and does not try to address broader issues. Other efforts, such as [internationalization](https://www.w3.org/International/), address other inclusion issues. Keeping accessibility focused on disabilities encourages research and development on the specific needs of people with disabilities, and solutions that are optimized for these specific needs. Accessible Design ----------------- There are [guidelines, standards, and techniques for web accessibility]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/\" | relative_url }}), such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }})), which is the international standard [ISO/IEC 40500](https://www.w3.org/blog/2012/10/wcag-20-is-now-also-isoiec-405/). Yet when designers, developers, and project managers approach accessibility as a checklist to meet these standards, the focus is only on the technical aspects of accessibility. As a result, the human interaction aspect is often lost, and accessibility is not achieved. Combining accessibility standards and usability processes with real people ensures that web design is technically and functionally usable by people with disabilities. This is referred to as *usable accessibility* or *accessible user experience (UX)*. ### Usable Accessibility Web designers and developers can use usability processes, methods, and techniques, to address the user interface component of accessibility. While the considerations of people with disabilities are not always included in common practices, they can be easily integrated into user experience design. A key aspect is incorporating **real people** in design: - Ensuring that everyone involved in web projects understands the basics of [how people with disabilities use the Web]({{ \"/people-use-web/\" | relative_url }}), - [Involving users with disabilities]({{ \"/planning/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}) early and throughout the design process, and - [Involving users in evaluating web accessibility]({{ \"/test-evaluate/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}). **Accessibility standards** also have an important role in accessible design. For example, understanding the basic [Accessibility Principles]({{ \"/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/\" | relative_url }}) and using them for developing and evaluating early prototypes helps the development team provide basic accessibility in the earliest stages. Addressing accessibility at later stages becomes increasingly difficult. Also, usability processes and user involvement alone cannot address all accessibility issues. Even large projects cannot cover the diversity of disabilities, adaptive strategies, and assistive technologies. Accessibility guidelines, standards, and techniques ensure that the wide range of issues are adequately covered. Conclusion ---------- Accessibility practitioners and researchers can incorporate usability techniques to improve 'usable accessibility'. User experience designers and researchers can incorporate accessibility to make their designs work better for more people in more situations. Addressing accessibility, usability, and inclusion together can more effectively lead to a more accessible, usable, and inclusive web for everyone. Resources to help are linked throughout this page. For more on this topic, see [The role of accessibility in a universal web](http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/88013), which: - provides a more in-depth exploration of the importance and benefits of accessibility as a distinct discipline, and - encourages increased communication and coordination between accessibility, usability, and inclusion research and practice.",

    "text": "{::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Summary\" class=\"\" %} {:/} This page describes accessibility considerations when planning, scripting, storyboarding, recording, and producing audio and video. It covers **common accessibility barriers** including: * [missing description of visual information](#plan-description) (such as text in the video) for people who cannot see the video * [requiring sight to understand the content](#sensory) of the video * [making text in the video hard for some people to see ](#readable) because there is not enough contrast between the text and the background colors {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::options toc_levels=\"2,3\" /} {::nomarkdown} {% include toc.html type=\"start\" title=\"Page Contents\" %} {:/} - This will be replaced by an automatically generated TOC when using Markdown formatting. {:toc} {::nomarkdown} {% include toc.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Introduction This page addresses accessibility considerations when planning, scripting, storyboarding, recording, and producing audio and video. Some of the guidance below is related to requirements in Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and has links to a separate resource. _(The Planning page of this resource introduces the [WCAG Standard]({{ \"/media/av/planning/\" | relative_url }}#wcag-standard).)_ Other guidance is good practice. Additional guidance is in the resource [How to Make Your Presentations Accessible to All]({{ \"/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/\" | relative_url }}): * [Preparing Slides and Projected Material]({{ \"/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/\" | relative_url }}#preparing-slides-and-projected-material-speakers) * [During the Presentation]({{ \"/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/\" | relative_url }}#during-the-presentation-speakers) ## Audio ### Create high-quality audio – _recording setup_ * Use high-quality microphone(s) and recording software. * When feasible, record in a room that is isolated from all external sounds. * Avoid rooms with hard surfaces, such as tile or wood floors. ### Use low background audio – _recording, post-production_ (WCAG AAA) When the main audio is a person speaking and you have background music, set the levels so people with hearing or cognitive disabilities can easily distinguish the speaking from the background. Specifically, make the background sounds at least 20 decibels lower than the foreground speech content (with the exception of occasional sounds that last for only one or two seconds). Avoid sounds that can be distracting or irritating, such as some high pitches and repeating patterns. More information is in [Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.7: Low or No Background Audio (AAA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/low-or-no-background-audio.html). ### Speak clearly and slowly – _speakers_ Speak clearly. This is important for people wanting to understand the content, and for captioners. Speak as slowly as appropriate. This will enable listeners to understand better, and make the timing better for captions and sign language. ### Give people time to process information – _speakers, post-production_ Pause between topics. ### Use clear language – _script_ Avoid or explain jargon, acronyms, and idioms. For example, expressions such as “raising the bar” can be interpreted literally by some people with cognitive disabilities and can be confusing. ### Provide redundancy for sensory characteristics – _script_ (WCAG A) {#sensory} Make your information work for people who cannot see and/or cannot hear. For example, instead of saying: Attach this to the green end. Say: Attach the small ring to the green end, which is the larger end. More information that primarily addresses web pages, yet is relevant to audio and video, is in [Understanding Success Criterion 1.3.3: Sensory Characteristics (A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/sensory-characteristics.html). ## Video ### Avoid causing seizures – _storyboarding, post-production_ (WCAG A) Avoid anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period. More information is in [Understanding Success Criterion 2.3.2: Three Flashes (AAA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/three-flashes.html) and [Understanding Success Criterion 2.3.1: Three Flashes or Below Threshold (A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/three-flashes-or-below-threshold.html) ### Consider speaker visibility – _storyboarding, recording, post-production_ Some people use mouth movement to help understand spoken language. When feasible, ensure that the speaker's face is visible and in good light. ### Make overlay text readable – _storyboarding, post-production_ (WCAG AA, AAA) {#readable} For any text, consider the font family, size, and contrast between the text and background. More information is in [Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum) (AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html) and [Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.6: Contrast (Enhanced) (AAA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced). ### Plan for sign language – _storyboarding, script, recording_ (WCAG AAA) Often sign languages are provided as an overlay in the bottom right corner of videos. For example: [NHS 111 British Sign Language (BSL) Advert (YouTube){% include image.html src=\"sign-example.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"normal video\" %}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCq3ru9HQSc) Plan for the video not to include important information that would be obstructed by a sign language overlay. For other guidance including recording, see another page of this resource: [Sign Languages]({{ \"/media/av/sign-languages/\" | relative_url }}) ### Plan for audio description of visual information – _storyboarding, recording_ (WCAG A, AA) {#plan-description} _Description_ provides content to people who are blind and others who cannot see the video adequately. It describes the visual information needed to understand the content, **including text displayed in the video**. Plan to either: * Integrate description into the main audio content,_**or**_ * Record the audio and video with timing to accommodate separate description. #### Integrate description For some videos, such as presentations and instructional videos, the best way to handle audio description is not to need it at all &mdash; that is, all the visual information that users need to understand the content is integrated in the main audio. When planned in advance, this is fairly simple for many videos on the web. For example: Instead of the speaker saying: The speaker can say: As you can see on this chart, sales increased significantly from the first quarter to the second quarter. This chart shows that sales increased significantly, from 1 million in the first quarter to 1.3 million in the second quarter. Whip the mixture until it looks like this. Whip the mixture until the oil, vinegar, and spices are well combined. Attach this to the green end. Attach the small ring to the green end, which is the larger end. Here is an example [training video with the description integrated in what the trainer is saying (YouTube){% include image.html src=\"eg-integrated-description.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"normal video\" %}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUfmCvdzqbM) If you want guidance on what to include in description, see the \"Creating Audio Description of Visual Information\" page, [Tips for Writing Description section]({{ \"/media/av/description/\" | relative_url }}#writing). #### Time for description For some types of videos, such as dramas, the description of the visual information cannot be smoothly handled by the speakers in the main video. For those videos, the description will be separate. Where the description is fairly short, plan space in the audio to add the description. Where the description is longer than you want to leave space in the main audio, you can record extra time in the scene to accommodate the description without having to pause the scene. That is, the same scene is shorter in the main video. In the described version, that same scene is a little longer at the beginning or the end of it. For example: Narration Main Video Scene Duration Described Video Scene Duration Description Captions are also handy for people who want to watch video in loud environments. 3&nbsp;seconds 7&nbsp;seconds A man is watching the captioned video with a group of people chatting away next to him. Or where you need to be very, very quiet. 2&nbsp;seconds 5&nbsp;seconds Turns out that they are in a library. The group is shushed by the librarian. An example of this is the [Web Accessibility Perspectives: Video Captions]({{ \"/perspective-videos/captions/\" | relative_url }}) video. The main video is 48 seconds long. The described version is 1 minute and 18 seconds long, yet there are no pauses in the visual aspect of the video. #### More about description More information is in the next page of this resource: [Audio Description of Visual Information]({{ \"/media/av/description/\" | relative_url }}).",

Outline the increasing uptake internationally, including in the [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html). * Provide some examples of legal incidences with organizations in your region. If it is not possible, you can use examples from [The Business Case for Digital Accessibility (Minimize Legal Risk)]({{ \"/business-case/\" | relative_url }}#minimize-legal-risk). * Refer to specific legal cases related to accessibility and present their settlements or outcomes. Find cases that were both upheld as well as dismissed to determine the reasons for the outcome and explore why the case was brought up. #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practice &mdash; Students perform a specific task with the virtual assistant in their mobile phones. For example, students read the news, query the weather, or check items into a shopping cart. Assess students' capacity to recognize innovation behind features originally designed for accessibility that many people use nowadays. * Portfolio &mdash; Students research how an organization could benefit from improving accessibility. Assess students' capacity to outline business opportunities gained from taking this approach. * Presentation &mdash; Students research and describe different mainstream accessibility features that they are already using, for example on their mobile phone, or accessibility features that they may want to use in the future. Assess students' capacity to identify accessibility features that others can enjoy. * Report &mdash; Students write a report about publicly-available accessibility testimonials and business case arguments from different organizations. Advise students that testimonials are often not easy to verify and may require further analysis. Assess students' capacity to identify business case arguments that others are using to implement accessibility. * Reflective Journal &mdash; Students study article 9 of the [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html) and share their understanding of the core concepts of it. Assess students' understanding of the core concepts of article 9. * Portfolio &mdash; Students research if there are accessibility laws and policies applicable to an organization of their choice. Assess students' understanding of implications of legal requirements depending on business sector, size, and nature of organizations. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} ## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module Optional ideas to support assessment: * Guided Quiz &mdash; From a list of business case arguments, students describe the benefits that match the corresponding business case arguments. Assess students' capacity to relate business case arguments to benefits. * Presentation &mdash; Students present business case arguments that are applicable to an organization of their choice. Assess students' capacity to explain the rationale for each argument. * Open Book Exam &mdash; Students answer questions about the scope and applicability of specific policies from [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies]({{ \"/policies/\" | relative_url }}). Assess students' capacity to identify how laws and policies impact a particular organization. ## Teaching Resources Suggested resources to support your teaching: * [The Business Case for Digital Accessibility]({{ \"/business-case/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; Explains the rationale for organizations to pursue digital accessibility for people with disabilities. This includes driving innovation, enhancing brand, extending market reach, and minimizing legal risk. It includes case studies from different organizations. * [Developing an Accessibility Business Case for your Organization (Archived)]({{ \"/business-case/archive/\" | relative_url }}). * [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html) &mdash; Lists the countries that signed and ratified the convention and optional protocol, and provides news and information on implementation of the convention. * [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies]({{ \"/policies/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; Lists governmental policies related to web accessibility. * [Older Users and Web Accessibility: Meeting the Needs of Ageing Web Users]({{ \"/older-users/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; Explains the overlapping needs of ageing web users and web users with disabilities, and how accessibility addresses both situations.

    "text": "Rule Type: : atomic Rule ID: : 97a4e1 Last Modified: : Oct 1, 2020 Accessibility Requirements Mapping: : [4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value) - **Required for conformance** to WCAG 2.0 and later on level A and higher - [Outcome](#outcome) mapping: - Any `failed` outcomes: success criterion is not satisfied - All `passed` outcomes: success criterion needs further testing - An `inapplicable` outcome: success criterion needs further testing Input Aspects: : [Accessibility Tree](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-aspects/#input-aspects-accessibility) : [DOM Tree](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-aspects/#input-aspects-dom) : [CSS Styling](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-aspects/#input-aspects-css) ## Description This rule checks that each `button` element has a non-empty accessible name. ## Applicability The rule applies to elements that are [included in the accessibility tree][] and have a [semantic role](#semantic-role) of `button`, except for `input` elements with a `type` [attribute value] of `image`. ## Expectation Each target element has an [accessible name][] that is not empty (`\"\"`). **Note:** `input` elements with a type [attribute value][] of either `submit` or `reset` can get their [accessible name][] from a [default text](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/#input-type-button-input-type-submit-and-input-type-reset), as well as from a `value` or other attribute. ## Assumptions - The rule assumes that all buttons are [user interface components as defined by WCAG 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-user-interface-components). ## Accessibility Support - Implementation of [Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][] varies from one browser or assistive technology to another. Depending on this, some elements can have a [semantic role][] of `button` and fail this rule with some technology but users of other technologies would not experience any accessibility issue. ## Background - [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0 (working draft), 5.2 `input type=\"button\"`, `input type=\"submit\"` and `input type=\"reset\"`](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/#input-type-button-input-type-submit-and-input-type-reset) - [Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value) - [ARIA14: Using aria-label to provide an invisible label where a visible label cannot be used](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA14) - [ARIA16: Using aria-labelledby to provide a name for user interface controls](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA16) ## Test Cases ### Passed #### Passed Example 1 This `button` element has an [accessible name][] because of its text content. ```html My button ``` #### Passed Example 2 This `input` element has an [accessible name][] because of its `value` attribute. ```html ``` #### Passed Example 3 This `button` element has an [accessible name][] because of its `aria-label` attribute. ```html ``` #### Passed Example 4 This element with a `button` role has an [accessible name][] because of its `aria-label` attribute. ```html ``` #### Passed Example 5 This `button` element with the `disabled` attribute has an [accessible name][] because of its text content. ```html Delete ``` #### Passed Example 6 This off screen `button` element has an [accessible name][] because of its text content. ```html Save ``` #### Passed Example 7 This `input` element has an [accessible name][] because of the default accessible name for an `input` element with a `type` attribute set to `reset`. ```html ``` ### Failed #### Failed Example 1 This `button` element has no [accessible name][] because it has no content or attribute that can provide it. ```html ``` #### Failed Example 2 This `button` element has no [accessible name][]. The `value` attribute does not provide an [accessible name][] for `button` elements, only when an `input` element's [state of the `type` attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#states-of-the-type-attribute) is `button`, `submit` or `reset`. ```html ``` #### Failed Example 3 This element with the `button` role has no [accessible name][] because it has no content or attribute that can provide it. ```html ``` #### Failed Example 4 This off screen `button` element has no [accessible name][] because it has no content or attribute that can provide it. ```html ``` #### Failed Example 5 This `button` element has an [explicit role][] of `none`. However, it is [focusable][] (by default). Thus it has a [semantic role][] of `button` due to [Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][]. It has an empty [accessible name][]. ```html ``` ### Inapplicable #### Inapplicable Example 1 This `input` element has a `type` attribute set to `image`. These images are tested in a separate rule which also tests [success criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-content). ```html ``` #### Inapplicable Example 2 This `button` element does not need an [accessible name][] because it is not included in the accessibility tree. ```html ``` #### Inapplicable Example 3 This `button` element has a `link` role. Links are tested in a separate rule which also tests [success criterion 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#link-purpose-in-context). ```html take me somewhere ``` #### Inapplicable Example 4 There is no element with a semantic role of `button`. ```html Press Here ``` #### Inapplicable Example 5 This `button` element has an [explicit role][] of `none`; it is not [focusable][] because it is `disabled`. Thus it has a [semantic role][] of `none`. ```html ``` ## Glossary {% include_relative glossary/accessible-name.md %} {% include_relative glossary/attribute-value.md %} {% include_relative glossary/explicit-role.md %} {% include_relative glossary/focusable.md %} {% include_relative glossary/hidden-state.md %} {% include_relative glossary/implicit-role.md %} {% include_relative glossary/included-in-the-accessibility-tree.md %} {% include_relative glossary/marked-as-decorative.md %} {% include_relative glossary/outcome.md %} {% include_relative glossary/semantic-role.md %} {% include_relative glossary/wai-aria-specifications.md %} ## Acknowledgements This rule was written in the [ACT Rules community group](https://w3.org/community/act-r/), with the support of the EU-funded [WAI-Tools Project](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/projects/wai-tools/). ### Authors - [Stein Erik Skotkjerra](https://github.com/skotkjerra) - [Wilco Fiers](https://github.com/wilcofiers) ## Changelog This is the first version of this ACT rule.

They are also used by people who process written information better than audio. {% include image.html src=\"captions.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"normal right\" %} _What:_ Captions are a text version of the speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the content. They are displayed within the media player and are synchronized with the audio. Most are \"closed captions\" that can be hidden or shown by people watching the video. They can be \"open captions\" that are always displayed and cannot be turned off. ### Captions and Subtitles The terms \"captions\" and \"subtitles\" are used for the same thing in different regions of the world. This resource uses: * _Captions_ for the same language as the spoken audio. * _Subtitles_ for spoken audio translated into another language. Some regions use _subtitles_ for both the same language as the audio and for the translation. Sometimes they are distinguished as _intralingual subtitles_ (same language) and _interlingual subtitles_ (different language). Subtitles are implemented the same way as captions. Subtitles/interlingual subtitles are usually only the spoken audio (for people who can hear the audio but do not know the spoken language). They can be a translation of the caption content, including non-speech audio information. Captions are needed for accessibility, whereas subtitles in other languages are not directly an accessibility accommodation. ### Live Captions Live captions are usually done by professional real-time captioners (also called Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) providers). Live captions can be done in-person or remotely. That is, the person doing the captioning/CART does not have to be at the same location as the live action; they can be doing the live captions by listening to the audio over a phone or Internet connection. If you have live captions and you post a recording, you will probably need to do minor editing for accuracy. This rest of this page addresses developing captions for pre-recorded media. ### Interactive Transcripts from Captions {:.no_toc} Caption files are used by some media players to provide _interactive transcripts_. Interactive transcripts highlight text phrases as they are spoken. Users can select text in the transcript and go to that point in the video. Some players provide interactive transcript functionality. ### Notes {:.no_toc} For optimum accessibility, provide a separate caption file of the audio description. **Captions and transcripts include the same text, so one can be used to develop the other.** ## Does My Media Need Captions? {#checklist} This section tells you: * What is required in the WCAG standard at Level A, AA, and AAA. _([WCAG]({{ \"/media/av/planning/\" | relative_url }}#wcag-standard) is introduced in the Planning page of this resource.)_ * What is needed to meet user needs, beyond WCAG.

Transcribing an audio file is fairly difficult and takes quite a bit of time for people who don't have the software and skill for it. The file format for captions are simple, yet it's tedious to add timestamps, especially without software or service for developing caption files. Creating high-quality captions requires knowledge of which non-speech audio information should be included in the captions. It's more art than science --- for example, it's not always clear which non-speech audio information to include and how to communicate it in text. Even correcting an automatic caption files takes quite a bit of time for people who don't do it regularly. However, people who have the software, skills, and experience in developing captions, can develop them much faster. For these reasons, many organizations choose to outsource their captions. ## Automatic Captions are Not Sufficient Automatically-generated captions do not meet user needs or accessibility requirements, unless they are confirmed to be fully accurate. Usually they need significant editing. There are tools that use speech recognition technology to turn a soundtrack into a timed caption file. For example, some common video websites provide automatic captions. However, often the automatic caption text is wrong and does not match the spoken audio — sometimes in ways that change the meaning (or are embarrassing). For example, missing just one word such as \"not\" can make the captions contradict the actual audio content. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Example of bad automatic captions (that cause a fire)\" class=\"simple aside\" %} {:/} {% include image.html src=\"food-fire.jpg\" alt=\"food on fire under broiler\" class=\"normal right\" %} _Spoken audio:_&quot;Broil on high for 4 to 5 minutes. You should not preheat the oven.&quot; _Automatic caption:_&quot;Broil on high for 45 minutes. You should know to preheat the oven.&quot; {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} Automatic captions can be used as a starting point for developing accurate captions and transcripts. ## Creating Captions ### Caption File Format The most common format for captions on the web is [WebVTT](https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt/): The Web Video Text Tracks Format. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Example VTT file with speakers identified\" class=\"\" %} {:/} ``` WEBVTT 00:11.000 --> 00:13.000 Welcome to the podcast. 00:13.000 --> 00:17.000 Thank you for this opportunity to share information about accessibility. 00:17.000 --> 00:20.000 Would you start by telling us a little about your role at W3C? 00:20.000 --> 00:24.000 I work within the Web Accessibility Initiative, W-A-I, pronounced \"way\". ``` {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} Other caption formats are: Timed Text Markup Language ([TTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml2/)) and [SRT](https://matroska.org/technical/specs/subtitles/srt.html). ### Caption Tools Most people use software or services to help develop captions. There are several free captioning software programs and online services available. Several free and fee-based tools create automatic captions that you can use as a starting point. For example, a common video website includes automatic captions and tools for you to edit the captions. **You will need to edit automatic captions for accuracy.** If you already have transcription of the audio into text, there are free tools that will generate a captions file with timestamps. You will need to edit it for line breaks as described in another page of this resource, Transcribing Audio to Text: [More on Captions]({{ \"/media/av/transcribing/\" | relative_url }}#more-on-captions). Most caption-editing tools can export a plain text transcript. _The screen capture shows one tool for editing captions, in the area underneath the video._ ### Transcribing Audio to Text For specific guidance on what to type up, see another page in this resource: [Transcribing Audio to Text](/WAI/media/av/transcribing/). ## Positioning and Styling Captions There are options for authors to position and style captions. Support in browsers and other media players is inconsistent and sometimes unreliable. Most web videos just use the player's default presentation style, which is usually white characters in a black box. Some media players enable users to set preferences for how and where captions are displayed, including text style, text size, colors, and position of the captions.",

Before commenting, please read WCAG introductory and education material, including: - [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}) - [WCAG 2 Documents]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/docs/\" | relative_url }}) ## How to Comment {#how} There are multiple ways to provide comments on WCAG 2.0 and related documents: - [GitHub pull request](#how_github) - [Online Form](#how_form) - [Email comment submission](#how_email) ### GitHub pull request {#how_github} The [source XML documents for WCAG 2.0 and related documents are available on GitHub {% include_cached external.html %}](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/tree/master/wcag20/sources). Commenters familiar with GitHub can [fork {% include_cached external.html %}](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-forks/) the [WCAG 2.0 repository {% include_cached external.html %}](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/), clone that to their local machine, edit the source files, and submit a well-commented [pull request {% include_cached external.html %}](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) as a way to provide comments and edits to the working group for review. If you later decide to make another pull request, first [sync your fork {% include_cached external.html %}](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) to be sure your edits will be based on the the latest content. The [WCAG 2.0 sources](http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/sources/) page includes basic information about the files contained in the GitHub repository to help commenters understand which files to edit. Suggestions for comments submitted via GitHub pull requests: 1. Provide a complete summary and description for each pull request. The Working Group needs to understand the rationale for proposed changes. This description may need to be very detailed in some cases, such as if proposing to remove a technique; or may be quite brief, for example if providing a change to address a spelling issue. 2. Keep pull requests specific to individual comments. Some comments may require changes to multiple source files, for example if an external link is incorrect in multiple files, and this is appropriate if the changes all relate to the same comment. However, if several separate comments are submitted together within a single pull request not only is it more difficult for the working group to parse the different points made in the comment but unless the group agrees with all aspects of the comment the pull request may need to be rejected. In this case, the accepted parts of the comment will be added separately, but utilizing the commenter's contribution is more difficult. 3. If the commenter does not know what edits need to be made, comments and relevant details can be shared with the working group by [creating an issue in GitHub {% include_cached external.html %}](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues). When a pull request is accepted by the Working Group, an editor will integrate changes into the working branch. When it is time to publish the complete document as a refreshed document (about every six months) then the working branch will be merged into the master branch. Pull requests and issues that are accepted by the working group will be merged into the source documents and the commenter will receive a notification from GitHub that the pull request was accepted and an email indicating this will also be sent to the public WCAG comments email list. ### Online Form {#how_form} **Please use [online comment form](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/comments/onlineform.html) to comment on:** - [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) - [How to Meet WCAG (Quickref)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) - [Understanding WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/) - [Techniques for WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/) *(For WCAG 2.0 documents not in the list above, send comments to , a publicly archived list.)* When you use the form, your comments are automatically entered into our comment tracking database. ### Email comment submission {#how_email} If you cannot use the form, you can send comments to ****.

Content providers can use these logos on their sites to indicate a claim of conformance to a specified conformance level of WCAG. **Note that these logos do not represent review or validation of conformance by W3C and/or WAI.** Conformance to WCAG 2 is defined in the [Conformance section](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#conformance) of WCAG. Here is the excerpt that defines the conformance levels: * For Level A conformance (the minimum level of conformance), the Web page satisfies all the Level A Success Criteria, or a conforming alternate version is provided. * For Level AA conformance, the Web page satisfies *all the Level A and Level AA Success Criteria*, or a Level AA conforming alternate version is provided. * For Level AAA conformance, the Web page satisfies *all the Level A, Level AA and Level AAA Success Criteria*, or a Level AAA conforming alternate version is provided. Please see [WCAG 2 Conformance section](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#conformance) for more information on what is required in a conformance claim. ## How to use the logos {#howto} Place the icon for the appropriate conformance level using the HTML source code below. ### WCAG 2.1 #### WCAG 2.1 Level A Conformance Put the following HTML markup in your page: ```html ``` If you would like to use the blue logo, append \"-blue\" to the image src. #### WCAG 2.1 Level AA Conformance Put the following HTML markup in your page: ```html ``` If you would like to use the blue logo, append \"-blue\" to the image src. #### WCAG 2.1 Level AAA Conformance Put the following HTML markup in your page: ```html ``` If you would like to use the blue logo, append \"-blue\" to the image src. ### WCAG 2.0 #### WCAG 2.0 Level A Conformance Put the following HTML markup in your page: ```html ``` If you would like to use the blue logo, append \"-blue\" to the image src. #### WCAG 2.0 Level AA Conformance Put the following HTML markup in your page: ```html ``` If you would like to use the blue logo, append \"-blue\" to the image src. #### WCAG 2.0 Level AAA Conformance Put the following HTML markup in your page: ```html ``` If you would like to use the blue logo, append \"-blue\" to the image src. ## Logos The blue and gold colors do not indicate any difference. We offer the two options for flexibility with your visual design. Below are the logos as they will appear in your site. You may also choose to download and use local copies of the logos, using the links provided for each logo. You will have to adjust the HTML accordingly, and please use the same alternative text and link for the logo. ### WCAG 2.1 Logos &nbsp; A AA AAA Gold (png, gif, svg, eps) (png, gif, svg, eps) (png, gif, svg, eps) Blue (png, gif, svg, eps) (png, gif, svg, eps) (png, gif, svg, eps) ### WCAG 2.0 Logos &nbsp; A AA AAA Gold (png, gif, svg, eps) (png, gif, svg, eps) (png, gif, svg, eps) Blue (png, gif, svg, eps) (png, gif, svg, eps) (png, gif, svg, eps) ## Responsibility for accuracy of claims {#responsibility} Content providers are solely responsible for the use of these logos. Before using these logos as part of a conformance claim, we recommend that the provider understand [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and sufficiently [evaluate accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/conformance/) to ensure that pages using this logo meet the conformance level claimed. Providers should also ensure that anyone maintaining or updating the site is familiar with WCAG and the logo use, and either re-reviews the page or removes the logo from the page if they are unsure whether it still meets a specified conformance level. **Please note that use of this logo is not based on an automated test.** No tool alone can determine if a page conforms to WCAG requirements. Sometimes evaluation tools can produce false or misleading results. Knowledgeable human evaluation is required to determine if a page is accessible. For these reasons, the logos on this page are used to indicate only a claim of conformance made by thorough evaluation, _not only tool evaluation_. ## Scope of the claim {#scope} By default, a conformance icon refers to a single page. If the claim is meant to apply to include more than one page, the conformance icon must be accompanied by explicit scope information explaining which pages are covered by the claim.",

Demonstrate how native HTML interactive elements, such as controls and links, provide such semantics by default. Demonstrate and explain the use of WAI-ARIA attributes to define additional roles when HTML interactive elements are not sufficient. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * explain how assistive technologies, such as text-to-speech and voice interaction, process roles to allow people with disabilities to identify and interact with widgets, and how missing role definitions make custom widgets unusable * identify the appropriate roles for widgets, including buttons, carousels, sliders, tabs, treeviews, and others defined in the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices, section [Design patterns and widgets](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#aria_ex) * identify when HTML controls, such as `button`, `input`, and `option` as well as HTML links, can be used as the basis for custom widgets, such as buttons that are styled as switches, text input fields that are styled as sliders, and such * explain the accessibility benefits of using native HTML interactive elements, such as controls and links, as the basis for creating custom widgets rather than using non-interactive elements, such as `div`, `span`, and `section`, as the basis * write code for custom widgets using native HTML interactive elements, such as controls and links, with the necessary styling * write code for custom widgets using additional WAI-ARIA attributes when native HTML interactive elements are not sufficient * describe related requirements for content authors and designers to ensure that custom widgets are easy to understand #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Show examples of standard and custom widgets such as buttons, checkboxes, and lists. Emphasize that widgets created with standard HTML elements that convey semantic information inherit roles by default. However, custom widgets need to have these roles expressed explicitly, especially when using HTML elements with not enough semantic information. * Compare use of standard and custom widgets with assistive technologies. Explain that accessibility support for WAI-ARIA properties may vary, so checking its current accessibility support is recommended. Mention that WAI-ARIA roles override the implicit roles of native HTML elements where they are used. For an explanation of how WAI-ARIA can provide both powerful and dangerous experiences see the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices [Read me first](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#no_aria_better_bad_aria). * Explain that accessibility properties allow people using assistive technologies to get semantic information about a widget. Mention that widgets requiring extended keyboard interaction put assistive technologies into application mode, where all keyboard and focus interactions are controlled by the author of the widget. Mention that some assistive technologies provide custom hints based on these properties so that people can interact with those widgets more efficiently. * Show examples of WAI-ARIA roles applied to different types of custom widgets where native HTML elements do not convey enough semantic information. Explain that these roles help assistive technologies determine its type. For a list of roles, see the WAI-ARIA specification [roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles). #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practical &mdash; Give students a set of HTML elements and ask students about the semantics they convey. Assess students' knowledge of HTML elements and their associated semantic properties. * Practical &mdash; Give students different custom widgets that do not contain accessibility properties and ask students to code them using standard HTML elements to the extent possible. Assess students' understanding of when to use standard and custom widgets. * Practical &mdash; Give students custom widgets that do not convey roles by default and ask students to assign their roles. Assess how students code roles for custom widgets. * Short Answer Questions &mdash; Ask students about the different roles that exist in the WAI-ARIA specification. Assess students' knowledge of the different roles in the WAI-ARIA specification. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: Accessible Names and Descriptions {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Refer back to [Module 5: Forms]({{ \"/curricula/developer-modules/forms/\" | relative_url }}) to review the importance of labels for controls. Demonstrate how custom widgets also require similar labeling techniques, and explain how to provide accessible names for widgets. Demonstrate how some custom widgets require additional descriptions, and explain how to provide such descriptions for widgets. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * explain how assistive technologies, such as text-to-speech and voice interaction, use accessible names and descriptions to allow people with disabilities to identify, understand, and interact with custom widgets * write code to convey accessible names for custom widgets by using HTML elements and attributes such as `label`, `title`, and WAI-ARIA attributes such as `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` * write code to convey descriptions for custom widgets by adjusting label texts and by using the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-describedby` when necessary * describe how accessible names are calculated by different browsers and assistive technologies, and how this impacts the appropriate coding in different situations * describe related requirements for content authors and designers to provide appropriate accessible names and descriptions for custom widgets #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Explain that accessible names are short strings that provide information about the purpose and intent of widgets. Mention that descriptions are strings that provide additional information, such as instructions and required input formats. For explanations on what accessible names and descriptions mean in the context of Web accessibility, see the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices, [What are accessible names and descriptions](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#names_and_descriptions_definition). * Demonstrate different ways to code accessible names and descriptions, such as naming with child content, using strings in HTML `label` elements and the WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, and `aria-describedby`. Also explain the possible use of other HTML structures, such as legends, captions, and titles. For an explanation about how to code accessible names and descriptions, see the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices, [Providing accessible names and descriptions](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#names_and_descriptions). For examples of good practices when providing accessible names and descriptions, see the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices [Accessible names](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#accessible_names) and [Accessible descriptions](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#accessible_descriptions). * Mention that browsers use different algorithms to calculate accessible names and descriptions due to the multiple combinations that exist based on the coding patterns mentioned above. Show several browsers and examples of how they may render different accessible names from the same coding pattern. For a set of rules that help avoid mistakes when providing accessible names and descriptions, see the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices [How are name and description strings derived](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#names_and_descriptions_derivation). * Show how different assistive technologies present the contents of accessible names and descriptions. Explain that some present both types of contents consecutively, but others leave a pause between the accessible name and the accessible description. Mention that sometimes accessible descriptions require additional user input to be revealed by assistive technologies. #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Short Answer Questions &mdash; Ask students about the different ways in which accessible names and descriptions can be provided and the precedence of each. Assess students' knowledge of the different coding mechanisms to provide accessible names and descriptions. * Short Answer Questions &mdash; Ask students about the different ways in which assistive technologies can present the contents of accessible names and descriptions. Assess students' knowledge of the different ways in which assistive technologies present the contents of accessible names and descriptions. * Practical &mdash; Give students custom widgets that do not convey their accessible names and descriptions and ask students to provide these properties. Assess how students code accessible names and descriptions for custom widgets. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: States and Properties {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Demonstrate the use of states, properties, and values defined in the WAI-ARIA specification, [Supported States and Properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#states_and_properties) to create accessible widgets. Explain how states and properties, including their values, communicate the state of widgets. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * explain how assistive technologies, such as text-to-speech and voice interaction, use states and properties to allow people with disabilities to identify, understand, and interact with custom widgets * identify and write code for the appropriate states and properties to make widgets usable to people with disabilities; this includes: * [Global States and Properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#global_states) * [Widget Attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#attrs_widgets) * [Live Region Attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#attrs_liveregions) * [Drag-and-Drop Attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#attrs_dragdrop) * [Relationship Attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#attrs_relationships) * identify and write code for appropriate values for states and properties, and ensure these values are updated to reflect the current state of widgets as users interact with them and as they are otherwise updated * describe related requirements for content authors and designers to provide distinguishable styles for different states of custom widgets #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Provide examples of widgets using different WAI-ARIA states and properties. Explain that some attributes convey information about the current state of widgets, and others support interaction such as drag-and-drop and communicating changes to the content (live regions). * Demonstrate the use of WAI-ARIA global states and properties. Explain that they may be applied to any host language element as they are meant to extend the semantics provided by native elements. For examples of global attributes, see the WAI-ARIA specification [Global states and properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#global_states). * Demonstrate the use of states and properties for widget roles. Explain that they serve to communicate information about states, user input, and user actions. For reference on widget attributes, see the WAI-ARIA specification [Widget attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#attrs_widgets). * Demonstrate the use of properties and values to communicate drag and drop capabilities of a widget. For reference on drag-and-drop attributes, see the WAI-ARIA specification [Drag-and-drop attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#attrs_dragdrop). * Show examples of dynamic regions, such as carousels, chat logs, and feeds. Explain that people using screen readers cannot perceive these types of updates by default as they can only be focused at one thing at a time. Examples of how to communicate the changes using `aria-live` are provided in the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices, [Auto-rotating image carousel](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/carousel/carousel-1.html). * Show examples of widgets where the relationships or associations between its components cannot be established via document object model (DOM) order. Explain the use of WAI-ARIA properties to convey such relationships or associations. For examples of WAI-ARIA attributes that express relationships or associations between widget components, see the WAI-ARIA specification [Relationship attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#attrs_relationships). * Demonstrate the use of styling conventions to distinguish widget states from each other. Mention that styling different widget states is a shared responsibility among different team members: designers and developers. For tips on when (or when not) to make states distinguishable, see the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices [Focus vs selection and the perception of visual focus](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#kbd_focus_vs_selection). #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Short Answer Questions &mdash; Ask students about the differences between WAI-ARIA states, properties, and values. Assess students' knowledge of the WAI-ARIA attributes to convey states, properties, and values. * Practical &mdash; Give students a widget that reveals content based on user action and ask students to code it using `aria-haspopup` when necessary. Assess students' knowledge of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-haspopup`. * Practical &mdash; Give students custom widgets that have different states based on user action and ask students to code them accessibly. Assess how students code different states and its corresponding values. * Practical &mdash; Give students a widget that allows for drag-and-drop functionality and ask students to code it using WAI-ARIA attributes that convey such functionality. Assess students' knowledge of WAI-ARIA drag-and-drop attributes. * Practical &mdash; Give students a chat application and ask students to code it appropriately so that it can be understood by people using text-to-speech. Assess students' knowledge of the types of live regions as well as its roles and properties. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: Keyboard and Focus Management {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Demonstrate how people with different types of disabilities interact with widgets, and explain the relevance of appropriate keyboard commands, focus indicator, and meaningful sequence of items inside [composite widgets](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#composite), such as carousels, grids, listboxes, tabs, and treeviews. Explain relevant coding techniques and mechanisms to ensure appropriate focus and meaningful sequence when the state and contents of widgets are changed. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * explain how people with different types of disabilities interact with widgets, including keyboard only and voice interaction users, and how keyboard commands, including tab, arrow, and shortcut keys, are used to operate widgets * explain how people with different types of disabilities rely on meaningful sequence of items inside composite widgets * explain how people with different types of disabilities rely on focus indicators that are provided in the code and visually * write code that allows custom widgets to be operated using the keyboard only and other input devices, such as voice interaction * identify and write code for appropriate keyboard commands, including tab, arrow, and shortcut keys, to operate custom widgets * identify and write code for the appropriate order of items inside composite widgets, such as carousels, grids, listboxes, tabs, and treeviews, so that the different items can be navigated through keyboard in meaningful sequences * identify situations in which it is appropriate to use `tabindex`, including on non-focusable HTML elements, to change the tab order, and explain the potential accessibility challenges associated with manipulating the tab order * identify situations in which it is appropriate to use shortcut keys to facilitate keyboard and voice interaction, and explain the potential accessibility challenges associated with using shortcut keys, such as introducing potential conflicts with shortcut keys of operating systems, browsers, and assistive technologies * identify when changes to widgets, such as adding, removing, and updating items inside composite widgets, impact the current focus and sequence of items, and write code to restore appropriate focus and meaningful sequence when such changes occur * describe related requirements for content authors and designers to provide distinguishable styles for focus indicators #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Invite students to use the keyboard to navigate accessible widgets such as carousels, tabs, and treeviews. Explain that tabbing moves between widgets and using the arrow keys moves inside components. Emphasize that there should be only one tab stop per widget on a page, and that additional keyboard interactions are made available only when the widget gains focus. An explanation of these keyboard interactions is provided in the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices, [Fundamental keyboard navigation conventions](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#kbd_generalnav). * Show examples of well-formed DOM structures for composite widgets. Explain that a sequential DOM order allows for a predictable keyboard navigation. * Demonstrate the use of event listeners that allow for several ways of interaction. For example, keyboard, mouse, and tactile gestures. Emphasize that, in addition to making an element focusable, it is also necessary to take care of all additional functionality, such as which keys need to be pressed to operate it. For a pointer on what functionality needs to be added for a custom widget to allow keyboard functionality, see the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices [A role is a promise](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#a_role_is_a_promise). * Demonstrate the use of the `tabindex` attribute to add focus to an element that is not focusable by default. Explain the use of the value `-1` to mark up an element so that it can be focusable when it becomes visible. Explain the use of the value `0` to make an element focusable and put it in the relative order of the navigation according to the DOM structure. An example of how to use the `tabindex` attribute is provided in the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices, [Managing focus within components using a roving tabindex](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#kbd_roving_tabindex). * Demonstrate the use of focus indicators for users to keep track of where they are as they are interacting with the widget. Mention that providing the specific styles is a shared responsibility among different team members: designers, and developers. Tips on how to make navigation predictable within widgets are provided in the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices, section [Discernible and predictable keyboard focus](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#kbd_focus_discernable_predictable). #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Short Answer Questions &mdash; Ask students to provide all the meaningful values for accessibility that the `tabindex` attribute can have and to explain what each of those values means. Assess students' knowledge of the attribute `tabindex` and its values. * Practical &mdash; Give students a custom button and ask students to code it using WAI-ARIA roles, `tabindex` attribute, and event listeners for keyboard, mouse, and tactile devices. Assess students understanding of the different ways in which users can interact with custom widgets. * Practical &mdash; Give students a custom list and ask students to code a tab stop for its container layer. Assess how students understand sequential focus order and navigation. * Practical &mdash; Give students a treeview and ask students to code focus management and internal keyboard interactions. Assess how students understand internal keyboard interaction conventions. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"all\" %} ## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practical &mdash; Ask students to select a date from an accessible calendar widget using only the keyboard. Assess students' knowledge of keyboard interactions for custom widgets. * Portfolio &mdash; Students add custom widgets to the website they are building. Assess students' knowledge of the WAI-ARIA roles and properties to expand semantics of host languages as well as additional states and keyboard interactions. ## Teaching Resources Suggested resources to support your teaching: * [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) &mdash; Provides readers with an understanding of how to use WAI-ARIA 1.1 to create accessible rich internet applications. * [How People with Disabilities Use the Web]({{ \"/people-use-web/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; Provides stories of people with disabilities using the Web; describes types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies that some people use. * [Notifications and Feedback (Web Accessibility Perspectives)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/notifications/) &mdash; Is one of the Web accessibility perspectives videos that show accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities. * [Keyboard Compatibility (Web Accessibility Perspectives)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/keyboard/) &mdash; Is one of the Web accessibility perspectives videos that show accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities. * [Text to Speech (Web Accessibility Perspectives)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/speech/) &mdash; Is one of the Web accessibility perspectives videos that show accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities. * [Clear Layout and Design (Web Accessibility Perspectives)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/layout/) &mdash; Is one of the Web accessibility perspectives videos that show accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities. * [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) &mdash; Address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. * [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) &mdash; Describes the roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements and can be used to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications. * [HTML5 living standard {% include_cached icon.html name=\"external-link\" %}](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) &mdash; The core markup language for the web.",

(For example, \"Pat opens a small box, looks at a diamond engagement ring, and cries\".) Depending on the type of video and media player, description can be: * integrated into the main script and recording (which works well for some training videos, yet not most stories) * narration added to the main audio track and provided in an alternative version of the video (for stories) * provided in a text file or as a separate audio track (if supported by the media player) _Who:_ Description provides content to people who are blind and others who cannot see the video adequately. _Examples:_ * [Training video with the description integrated in what the trainer is saying (YouTube){% include image.html src=\"eg-integrated-description.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"normal video\" %}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUfmCvdzqbM) * [Alternative story video with audio description in a different voice (YouTube){% include image.html src=\"using-description.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"normal video\" %}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3A1VffiOH4) These videos are also available from the W3C website: training video (web page), story video (MP4 file size 28MB). ### Terminology {:.no_toc} Description of visual information provided via audio is called \"audio description\" in Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). In some regions and documents it is called \"video description\" or \"described video\". This resource uses \"described video\" in some places as a shortened form of \"a video that includes description of the visual information in audio\". ## Does My Media Need Description? {#checklist} This section tells you: * What is required in the WCAG standard at Level A, AA, and AAA. _([WCAG]({{ \"/media/av/planning/\" | relative_url }}#wcag-standard) is introduced in the Planning page of this resource.)_ * What is needed to meet user needs, beyond WCAG.

For some types of video (such as some training videos), description of the visual information can be seamlessly integrated by the speakers as the video is planned and created, and you don't need separate description, thus there is no additional cost. Information on planning for description in _new videos_ is in the \"Creating Audio and Video Content\" page, [Plan for Audio Description of Visual Information section]({{ \"/media/av/av-content/\" | relative_url }}#plan-description). To add description to _an existing video_, you'll either need skills and tools to: * write it * create a VTT file with the timed descriptions Or: * write it * narrate it * record it * integrate it in new audio and/or video files Many organizations choose to outsource their description. ## What Method of Description? What method to use for description depends on your video content and the media player that you use. First, figure out these issues about your video content, timing, and player: * **Integrated** &mdash; For new videos, can the speakers describe the relevant visual information as the video is recorded? This works for well for some videos, such as presentations and instructional videos. For examples, see the \"Creating Audio and Video Content\" page, [Integrated Description section]({{ \"/media/av/av-content/\" | relative_url }}#integrate-description). * **Media player support** &mdash; Information about media player functionality is in the Accessible Media Players page under [Existing Players]({{ \"/media/av/player/\" | relative_url }}#existing-players). Does the media player, platform, or plug-in that you are using provide functionality for: * description from a text file? * a separate audio track for description? * **Space in audio** &mdash; Is there enough space in the main audio for the description? That is, are there sufficient pauses throughout the narration or speaking where the relevant description will fit? For example, * If the only description needed is at the beginning of the video where these is a text title and background music, then: Yes, there is enough space. * If the speaker talks continually without pausing, then: No, there is not enough space for description. ***Use the information from above to answer the following questions*** in order to determine what method to provide description for your video. The options listed first are usually the best, yet you can choose another option. {% capture boxhead %} Description method: {% endcapture %} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=boxhead class=\"highlighted\" id=\"method-tree\" %} {:/} * Is it a new video _and_ can the speakers describe the visual information in the main audio? * If yes, provide **integrated description** (no separate description is needed), _**or**_ another option below. * If no, will you use a media player that provides functionality for description from a text file? * If yes, provide description in a **timed text file**, _**or**_ another option below. * If no, will you use a media player that supports a separate audio track for the description, _and_ is there enough space in the main audio for the description? * If yes, provide description in a **separate audio file**, _**or**_ provide a **separate described video**. * If no, provide a **separate described video**. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Options for Creating Description Depending on your video situation, do one of the options below &mdash; as determined from the \"What Description to Provide for My Video?\" section above. ### Integrated &ndash; Creating Integrated Description This approach works for some new videos. The process to develop a video with integrated description is basically: 1. When writing the script, make sure all relevant visual information is included. See [Tips for Writing Descriptions below](#writing) and examples in Accessible Audio and Video Content, [Integrate description section]({{ \"/media/av/av-content/\" | relative_url }}#integrate-description)) 2. Before finalizing the video, check to confirm that all relevant visual information is covered in the audio. ### Text &ndash; Creating Description in a Text File This approach only works when the media player that you're using supports text-based audio description that is read aloud. And, either the description fits in the space of the main audio, or the player provides functionality to pause during audio description. It requires someone to create a timed text file &mdash; minimal skills are needed; tools are not required, yet, they make it faster and easier. The process to develop descriptions in a text file is basically: 1. Write out the descriptions. See [Tips for Writing Descriptions below](#writing). 2. Add the timestamps for the descriptions in the file format used by the media player. It is usually [WebVTT like the example below](#vtt). (Make sure the descriptions file is included with the video.) If the descriptions do not fit into the main audio space, provide instructions to users to set their player to pause the video during audio description. For example: {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"To set the video to pause for audio description of visual information:\" class=\"\" %} {:/} * Select \"Preferences\", then \"Descriptions\". The \"Audio Description Preferences\" box opens. * Under \"Text-based audio description\", select the checkbox for \"Automatically pause video when description starts\". * Select the Save button. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ### Audio Only &ndash; Creating Description in a Separate Audio File Only This approach only works when there is enough space in the main audio for the description, *and* the media player supports a separate audio track for the description. This requires skills and software for audio recording and audio editing. The process to develop description in a separate audio file is basically: 1. Write out the descriptions. See [Tips for Writing Descriptions below](#writing). 2. Record the descriptions. See [Tips for Recording Descriptions below](#recording). 3. Ensure the descriptions play in the audio spaces with the main video. 4. Provide a caption file of the description. [Example VTT file of audio description](#vtt) (Ensure the files are integrated with the player on the web page.) ### Video with Space &ndash; Creating a Separate Described Video - If Descriptions Fit in Audio Spaces This applies if the descriptions do fit in the spaces, as described in [Space in audio above](#space)_. It requires skills and software for audio recording and video editing. Depending on the player that you are using, you might need video software to regenerate the video. The process to develop a separate audio file is basically: 1. Write out the descriptions. See [Tips for Writing Descriptions below](#writing). 2. Record the descriptions. See [Tips for Recording Descriptions below](#recording). 3. Create a new audio file by combining the original audio and the new description audio. See [Tips for Combining Audio Files below](#combining). 4. Provide the file(s): * _**If**_ your player uses separate video and audio tracks,you're done. * _**If**_ your player uses a single video file that includes the audio,generate the new described video with the audio file that you just created. (Make sure on the web page where the video is available, the Described version uses the correct version that you just created.) ### Video Without Space &ndash; Creating a Separate Described Video - If Descriptions Do _Not_ Fit in Audio Spaces If all the descriptions do **not** fit in the spaces _(as described in [Space in audio above](#space)_), you'll need to develop a separate audio file and also edit the visual track. This requires skills and software for audio recording, audio editing, and video editing. The process to develop a separate audio file and edit the visual track is basically: 1. Write out the descriptions. See [Tips for Writing Descriptions below](#writing). 2. Record the descriptions. See [Tips for Recording Descriptions below](#recording). 3. Create a new audio file by combining the original audio and the new description audio. See [Tips for Combining Audio Files below](#combining). 4. Create a new video: * _**If**_ you have source video with longer scenes _(as described in Accessible Audio and Video Content, [Time for description section]({{ \"/media/av/av-content/\" | relative_url }}#time-for-description))_, recut the scenes longer to fill in the visual space where you need to accommodate the time for the description. * _**If not or if you're adding to an existing video**_, you will need to leave a static image in the video while the description is playing in the audio. (Make sure on the web page where the video is available, the Described version uses the correct version that you just created.) ### Other Options {:.no_toc} * Extended Description with SMIL &mdash; The only markup-based method for providing extended audio descriptions is to use SMIL 3.0. Support for SMIL is very limited. Implementations would most likely require plug-ins and/or heavily customized approaches. * Provide functionality for the video to pause for the description &mdash; This is not suggested in most cases because it requires extra coding and provides a less-than-optimum user experience. {% include_cached excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"tips\" %} ## Tips for Doing Description Yourself {% include_cached excol.html type=\"middle\" %} ### Tips for Writing Descriptions {#writing} {:.no_toc} * Describe the visual elements that are important to understand what the video is communicating. Imagine that you are describing the video to someone who cannot see it &mdash; what do you say? You don't need to describe every detail or things that are apparent from the audio. * Describe objectively, without interpretation, censorship, or comment. * Write description in present tense, active voice, and third-person narrative style. Generally, all text in the video should be included in the main audio (integrated description) or in the separate description. For example, title text at the beginning of the video, links and e-mail addresses shown at the end, speakers' names in text, and text in a presentation. The text does not have to be included verbatim (exactly word-for-word), yet all of the information conveyed by the text needs to be available in the main audio, in the separate description, or clearly with the video. More guidance on writing descriptions is available on the web, for example: [Description Tip Sheet {% include_cached external.html %}](https://dcmp.org/learn/227) and [How to Describe {% include_cached external.html %}](http://www.descriptionkey.org/how_to_describe.html). ### Tips for Recording Descriptions {#recording} {:.no_toc} * Use a voice, style, and delivery that is distinguishable from other voices used in the video. * Use a neutral voice that does not convey emotions. * When recording a single file with timed descriptions, voice the descriptions at the same time as the visual content, or right before the visual content. Don't put the description after the visual content. * See [guidance on audio content]({{ \"/media/av/av-content/\" | relative_url }}#audio). ### Tips for Combining Audio Files {#combining} {:.no_toc} * Put descriptions at the same time as the visual content, or right before the visual content. Don't put the description after the visual content. * Make the description clear above other noises. When mixing the descriptions with the main audio, lower the main audio level when the description plays and raise the description audio level. When the description is finished playing, lower the description audio level and raise the main audio level to its normal setting. Repeat this process (known as \"ducking\") for every description instance. {% include_cached excol.html type=\"end\" %} ### VTT File {:.no_toc} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Example VTT file of audio description\" class=\"\" id=\"vtt\" %} {:/} ``` WEBVTT 00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.980 A man sitting at a desk starts watching a video on his computer. 00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.780 The video on his computer shows a person speaking to the camera. 00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.140 It is playing with no audio. 00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.620 The man watching the video has a hearing aid. ``` {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/}",

WCAG 2.1 has the same documents. ### WCAG 2 Standard Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 is designed to be a stable, referenceable technical standard. Most people will use the supporting documents when developing web content and web tools, instead of the actual technical standards document. ### How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference) [How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference): A customizable quick reference to WCAG 2 requirements (Success Criteria) and techniques](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) is a **key resource for designers and developers using WCAG 2. It includes all the WCAG 2 guidelines and success criteria**. It is essentially the [WCAG 2 checklist](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/). The success criteria are the testable statements that define how web content meets (conforms to) WCAG 2. Under each success criteria are a list of sufficient techniques; that is, if you implement those techniques you meet the success criteria. It also lists common failures, that is, things that do not meet the guidelines. You can customize _How to Meet WCAG 2_ to show what you are interested in at the time. There are \"filters\" for different roles, topics, and technologies (such as HTML, CSS, ARIA). You can also select to show [Level A, AA, or AAA success criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#levels). ### Understanding WCAG 2 _Understanding WCAG 2: A guide to understanding and implementing Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2_ ([2.1 Understanding](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/), [2.0 Understanding](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/)) has additional details for people who want to understand the guidelines and success criteria more thoroughly. It provide extensive guidance, including the intent of the guideline or success criterion; how it helps people with different disabilities, browser and assistive technology support notes, examples, and resources, such as [tools to check color contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html#resources). ### Techniques for WCAG 2 _Techniques for WCAG 2: Techniques and Failures for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2_ ([2.1 Techniques]( https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/), [2.0 Techniques](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/)) gives specific guidance for developers on how to develop accessible web content. It provides general and technology-specific examples, including for HTML/XHTML, CSS, scripting, multimedia, and [WAI-ARIA]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/aria/\" | relative_url }}). There are also common failures that show what to avoid. ## Getting from one document to the other The WCAG 2 documents are interlinked. For example: - In WCAG 2, - Links such as \"How to Meet 1.1.1\" go to the **How to Meet WCAG 2** document, and jumps down to that section within the document. - Links such as \"Understanding 1.1.1\" links go to an **Understanding WCAG 2** topic page. - You can get to the [Contents list of all the Understanding topics](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/#understanding-pages) from the [Contents] button at the top. - You can get all the topics in one large web page from the \"single HTML version\" link in the footer of each topic page. - In both How to Meet WCAG 2 and Understanding WCAG 2, there are lists of techniques that are links. These links go to a **Techniques for WCAG 2** topic page. - You can get to the [Contents list of all the Techniques topics](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/#techniques) from the [Contents] button at the top. - You can get all the topics in one large web page from the \"single HTML version\" link in the footer of each topic page. ![diagram of documents described in the text]({{ \"/content-images/wai-intro-wcag/wcag20links-docs.png\" | relative_url }}) Figure 2: Example of links between documents ## Additional Resources There is additional educational material related to WCAG 2, including: - [Accessibility Principles]({{ \"/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/\" | relative_url }}) - [Web Accessibility Tutorials](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/) - [Essential Components of Web Accessibility]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}) provides the foundation for understanding the different accessibility standards.

    "text": "## 1. Definitions **authoring tool** : Includes WYSIWYG web page editing tools, content management tools, development tool for applet, scripts, or applications, non-text media (e.g. video, audio, images) editing tools, social media content authoring tools (e.g. blogs, wikis, social networks). **Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)** : Accessibility requirements for web authoring tools, including software and services that are used to produce web content, for example HTML editors, content management systems (CMS), or online forums. ATAG guidelines outline both how to make the tools accessible and also how the tools can be built to help create more accessible content. **internal website** : Website developed or procured to meet an internal ACME Inc. business need, such as timesheet management. Access to such sites is only available to ACME Inc. members of staff, both permanent and temporary. **public website** : Website developed or procured to support or inform ACME Inc. customers and members of the public. **user agent** : Includes browsers, media players and applications that render web content. **User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)** : Accessibility requirements for web browsers, media players, and some assistive technologies that process and present web content to users. **Web content** : Includes electronic documents, websites, services, and applications delivered via the web. **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0** : Accessibility requirements for web content, including text, images, audio-visual materials, and the code used for structure, style, and interactions. **website** : Includes websites, services, and applications created using Open Web Platform technologies. Note this includes web applications developed solely for mobile platform delivery. ## 2. Policy statement 1. All new and redesigned web content published after the effective date of this policy by ACME Inc, both for public and internal websites and services, will conform to WCAG 2.0 Level AA success criteria. 2. All existing web content published prior to the effective date of this policy will either be archived or modified to conform to WCAG 2.0 Level AA success criteria. Web content hosted on ACME Inc. public websites will be addressed no later than August, 20XX. Web content hosted on internal websites will be addressed no later than September, 2016. 3. All internal content management systems (CMS) and web content authoring tools will conform to ATAG Level AA success criteria by Jan, 2016. Where websites, services, or applications provide users with the opportunity to generate content, the interfaces provided will conform to ATAG Level AA. 4. All internal user agents will conform to UAAG Level AA success criteria by Jan, 2016. Where user agents are used as part of a website, service, or application, such as a media player, they will conform with UAAG Level AA success criteria by Oct, 20XX. 5. This policy does not stipulate any particular technology or design approach. The aim is to maximize access to and use of ACME Inc. websites by people with disabilities. ## 3. Need for policy 1. The June 2011 [World Health Organization (WHO) Report on Disability](http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/en/index.html) estimated that there are a billion people with disabilities. Many of these disabilities can affect access to information technologies, and/or can benefit from the use of information technologies including the Web. 2. Accessibility of the Web is of critical importance to people with disabilities around the world, including people with auditory, cognitive, physical, neurological, and visual disabilities, and is likewise important to those with accessibility needs due to aging. 3. Providing accessible web content can also benefit people who do not have disabilities but who are experiencing situational barriers. For instance, when accessing the Web from devices with small screens or in low bandwidth situations, or when experiencing barriers due to language or literacy levels, accessibility solutions can also support improved access. 4. ACME Inc. is committed to ensuring equal access for people with disabilities. As potential customers and employees they are important contributor to ACME Inc. business success and should not be excluded. 5. As a consequence of this policy, ACME Inc. will meet its legal obligations as defined by the @@@@. ## 4. Responsibilities 1. **Accessibility Coordinator** 1. Consolidate annual status reports for presentation to the board at annual review meeting. 2. Prepare and provide accessibility training and guidance. 3. Promote web accessibility awareness internally. 4. Respond to user enquiries related to web accessibility. 5. Organize on-going assessment of the accessibility of websites, content, services, and applications identified as in scope. 2. **Web project managers** 1. Ensure compliance with this policy. 2. Prepare project accessibility report at key project stages; analysis, design, development, and QA. 3. Ensure user feedback mechanisms are included as part of project deliverables. 4. Ensure all staff receive appropriate and regular accessibility training. 3. **ICT department and webmasters** 1. Choose and implement tools that conform to this policy. 2. Provide tools to support in automated accessibility checking. 3. Remedy identified accessibility barriers. 4. **Web content management teams** 1. Ensure all staff receive appropriate and regular accessibility training. 2. Ensure submitted content is compliant with this policy. 3. Fix identified accessibility issues in authored web content. ## 5. Exclusions {#scope} 1. Web content that has been archived is not subject to the standards referenced in this policy. 2. Should there be a specific request for access to archived content by any individual with a disability, that content will be made available in a suitable format within 10 business days. Where it is not technically possible to make the content available, a suitable alternative should be agreed with the individual. The department or team responsible for the creation of the content is responsible for making it accessible. ## 6. Procurement 1. This policy applies to all web content developed by or for ACME Inc. 2. This policy should be referenced within any contract of services or statements of work for web content, websites, services, or applications. 3. Any contract must include provision for an independent statement of conformance stating that the work meets the required standard. This should form part of the deliverables approval process. ## 7. Syndicated content {#syndicated} 1. Elements of ACME Inc. websites might include web content syndicated from other providers. For example, a social media stream. 2. When considering a syndication service for inclusion in any of ACME Inc. websites, any service review should include an evaluation of the accessibility of the service. Such evaluations must form a part of the service selection criteria. 3. Where a service is selected with known accessibility issues, ACME Inc. will develop or procure a solution that ensures the content delivered via ACME Inc. websites meets the policy standards. ## 8. Reporting 1. Each department with responsibility for web content, websites, services, or applications must submit an annual status report to the Accessibility Coordinator. 2. The status report will summarize the efforts and progress towards the aims defined by this policy. ## 9. Policy review 1.

    "text": "Rule Type: : atomic Rule ID: : 7d6734 Last Modified: : Oct 1, 2020 Accessibility Requirements Mapping: : [1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-content) - **Required for conformance** to WCAG 2.0 and later on level A and higher - [Outcome](#outcome) mapping: - Any `failed` outcomes: success criterion is not satisfied - All `passed` outcomes: success criterion needs further testing - An `inapplicable` outcome: success criterion needs further testing Input Aspects: : [DOM Tree](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-aspects/#input-aspects-dom) : [CSS Styling](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-aspects/#input-aspects-css) ## Description This rule checks that each SVG image element that is explicitly included in the accessibility tree has a non-empty accessible name. ## Applicability The rule applies to any element in the [SVG](https://www.w3.org/2000/svg) namespace with an [explicit semantic role][explicit role] of either `img`, `graphics-document`, `graphics-symbol`, that is [included in the accessibility tree][]. ## Expectation Each target element has an [accessible name][] that is not empty. ## Assumptions This rule assumes that the presence of one of the roles outlined in the applicability indicates the authors intent to include the element in the accessibility tree and thus convey information to the user about that element. ## Accessibility Support The [HTML Accessibility API Mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#html-element-role-mappings) specify that the `` element has an implicit role of `graphics-document`. However browser support for the `graphics-document` role and the [SVG Accessibility API Mappings][] is inconsistent. This rule is limited to the explicit use of roles, as a clear indication that content should convey meaning, until the [SVG Accessibility API Mappings][] is more stable and browser support is more consistent. Browser and assistive technology support for SVG `` and `` elements is currently inconsistent. Using WAI ARIA in combination with the `img` role for non-decorative `` elements significantly improves accessibility browser support. Until browser support for the [SVG Accessibility API Mappings][] is more consistent it is recommended to explicitly remove decorative `` elements from the accessibility tree. ## Background - [Understanding Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content.html) - [SVG Accessibility API Mappings (working draft)][svg accessibility api mappings] - [WAI-ARIA Graphics Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/graphics-aria-1.0/) - [ARIA4: Using a WAI-ARIA role to expose the role of a user interface component](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA4) - [ARIA6: Using aria-label to provide labels for objects](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA6) - [ARIA10: Using aria-labelledby to provide a text alternative for non-text content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA10) ## Test Cases ### Passed #### Passed Example 1 This `svg` element has an [explicit role][] of `img` and an [accessible name][] from the `title` element that is not empty. ```html How many circles are there? 1 circle ``` #### Passed Example 2 This `circle` element has an [explicit role][] of `graphics-symbol` and an [accessible name][] from the `aria-label` attribute that is not empty. ```html How many circles are there? ``` #### Passed Example 3 This `svg` element has an [explicit role][] of `graphics-document` and an [accessible name][] from the `title` element that is not empty. ```html How many circles are there? 1 circle ``` ### Failed #### Failed Example 1 This `svg` element has an [explicit role][] of `img` but has no [accessible name][]. ```html How many circles are there? ``` #### Failed Example 2 This `svg` element has an [explicit role][] of `img`, is included in the accessibility tree, but it has no [accessible name][] because the `title` element is empty. ```html How many circles are there? ``` #### Failed Example 3 This `circle` element has an [explicit role][] of `graphics-symbol` but has no [accessible name][]. ```html How many circles are there? ``` ### Inapplicable #### Inapplicable Example 1 Neither the `svg` element nor the `circle` element has any of the three [explicit roles][explicit role] of `img`, `graphics-document`, `graphics-symbol`. ```html ``` #### Inapplicable Example 2 This `svg` element and its descendants are not [included in the accessibility tree][] because of the `aria-hidden` attribute. ```html ``` #### Inapplicable Example 3 This `circle` element has an [explicit role][] that is neither `img`, `graphics-document` nor `graphics-symbol`. ```html ``` ## Glossary {% include_relative glossary/accessible-name.md %} {% include_relative glossary/explicit-role.md %} {% include_relative glossary/focusable.md %} {% include_relative glossary/included-in-the-accessibility-tree.md %} {% include_relative glossary/outcome.md %} {% include_relative glossary/wai-aria-specifications.md %} ## Acknowledgements This rule was written in the [ACT Rules community group](https://w3.org/community/act-r/), with the support of the EU-funded [WAI-Tools Project](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/projects/wai-tools/). ### Authors - [Bryn Anderson](https://github.com/brynanders) ## Changelog This is the first version of this ACT rule.

Where can I find answers to more of my questions? {:toc} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Is WCAG 2.0 stable? {#done} Yes. WCAG standards (called \"W3C Recommendations\") are a stable, referenceable standards that do not change. There may be later versions published. [WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) was published as a final W3C Recommendation Web Standard on 11 December 2008. [WCAG 2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) was published as a final W3C Recommendation Web Standard on 5 June 2018. **They will not change.** The supporting resources — Techniques for WCAG 2 and Understanding WCAG 2 — are updated periodically to reflect updates in technologies and best practices. *See also important information in the next answer about WCAG 2.1:* ## What about WCAG 2.1? {#v21} All requirements (\"success criteria\") from 2.0 are included in 2.1. The 2.0 success criteria are exactly the same (verbatim, word-for-word) in 2.1. The primary focus for WCAG 2.1 is additional accessibility requirements for: * [mobile accessibility]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/mobile/\" | relative_url }}) * people with low vision, * [people with cognitive and learning disabilities]({{ \"/cognitive/\" | relative_url }}) There are 17 additional success criteria in 2.1 that are not in 2.0. They are introduced in [What’s New in WCAG 2.1]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/\" | relative_url }}). **Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0**. (This is often called “backwards compatible”.) A website that meets WCAG 2.1 should meet the requirements of policies that reference WCAG 2.0. To put it another way: If you want to meet both WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1, you can use the 2.1 resources and you don't need to bother looking at 2.0. WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 are both existing standards. WCAG 2.1 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0. W3C encourages you to use the most recent version of WCAG when developing or updating content or accessibility policies. ## What about WCAG 2.2? {#v22} The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG) is developing WCAG 2.2, and plans to publish the final standard in 2021. The structure and content of WCAG 2.2 is the same as 2.1 and 2.0. Version 2.2 will include new accessibility requirements, called “success criteria”. You can review proposed additional success criteria in the [in-progress “Editors’ Draft” of WCAG 2.2](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/). **The proposed new WCAG 2.2 success criteria are introduced in [What's New in WCAG 2.2 Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/).** AG WG has not decided whether or not to do another version of WCAG 2 (WCAG 2.3). *They are currently working on WCAG 3.0:* ## What about WCAG 3.0? What about “Silver”? {#next} WCAG 3.0 is the result of the project previously temporarily referred to as “Silver”. **Please see important up-to-date information in the [WCAG 3 Introduction page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag3).** ### WCAG 3.0 Name {#wcag3name} WCAG 2 and WCAG 3 have different names. The new standard is currently referred to as “W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0”. This name was chosen because of wide-spread familiarity with the “WCAG” acronym, and to encompass the broader scope beyond “content”. ## How Can I Get Updates? {#getnews} We will announce when more information is available on WCAG 2.2 and WCAG 3.0. To get announcements of updated drafts for review in e-mail, tweets, and RSS, see [Get WAI News](https://www.w3.org/WAI/news/subscribe/). ## Does WCAG 2 address mobile accessibility? {#mobile} **Yes.** See the [Mobile Accessibility at W3C]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/mobile/\" | relative_url }}) page. ## Does VPAT 2.1 include WCAG 2.1? {#vpat21} No. Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) 2.1 includes information from WCAG 2.0. VPAT 2.1 does not include information from WCAG 2.1. (VPAT is not developed by W3C.) ## Where should I start? {#start} If you want a really short introduction to 3 web accessibility issues (alternative text for images, keyboard input, and transcripts), see [Examples of Web Accessibility]({{ \"/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/\" | relative_url }}#examples). To learn about web accessibility principles and guidelines, see [Accessibility Principles]({{ \"/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/\" | relative_url }}). **To learn about WCAG 2 specifically, start with the [WCAG Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}).** It provides an important foundation for understanding the different WCAG 2 documents, and points to several resources for using WCAG 2. [How to Meet WCAG 2: A customizable quick reference](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) is the primary resource for developers using WCAG 2. ## What are the different WCAG 2 documents? {#docs} To learn how the different WCAG 2 technical documents are related and linked, see [WCAG 2 Documents]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/docs/\" | relative_url }}). Here’s a little more perspective on the different technical documents. When web content and web software developers were using WCAG ***1.0***, they had many questions on how to implement it, how to evaluate for it, and the reasons behind its requirements. WAI wanted to provide this information with WCAG 2, and since those details don’t fit well in a technical standard, they are in the supporting documents. Thus with WCAG 2, there are extensive supporting materials, which are advisory documents. The WCAG 2 guidelines document itself is the only document that is a web standard, and it is fairly short. ## Do content authors (developers, designers, etc.) have to follow W3C’s techniques to meet WCAG? {#techs} **No**, you do not have to use the techniques in W3C’s Techniques for WCAG 2 document. The techniques are informative; that means they are not required. The basis for determining conformance to WCAG 2 is the success criteria from the WCAG 2 standard — not the techniques. While many authors find W3C-documented techniques useful, there may be other ways to meet WCAG success criteria. You can use other techniques. Web content could even fail a particular technique test, yet still meet WCAG in a different way. Also, content that uses some of the Techniques does not necessarily meet all WCAG success criteria. **For important additional information, see the [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria section](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) of Understanding WCAG 2.1**. ## What would be the negative consequences of allowing *only* W3C’s published techniques to be used for conformance to WCAG 2? {#techsnot} Background: Some organizations have considered requiring all web content to use W3C’s published techniques. **W3C recommends that the only thing that is required is meeting the WCAG 2 success criteria.** The basis for determining conformance to WCAG 2 is the success criteria from the WCAG 2 standard --- not the techniques. W3C’s _Techniques for WCAG 2_ document is informative (that is, not required, non-normative). **W3C cautions against requiring web content to use only W3C’s published sufficient techniques and not allowing other techniques** for several reasons, including: - **It would prevent the use of new technologies (for example, HTML5 and WAI-ARIA) while the technologies and relevant sufficient techniques are being developed, which is usually more than a year.** It often takes several years for technologies to be developed and finalized. Once a technology is stable, it usually takes several months for the WCAG Working Group to develop techniques, test them with user agents and assistive technologies, make them available for public review, revise them as needed, and formally publish them. - W3C’s *Techniques for WCAG 2* is not comprehensive and may not cover newer technologies and situations. There may be techniques that are sufficient to meet a given success criteria, but that are not yet included in W3C’s published document. - W3C’s published sufficient techniques may not always be the best techniques in a specific circumstance. - It is not always possible to use the W3C’s published sufficient techniques — for example, because of the way the content is designed — and there are other ways to meet the success criteria. - It would prevent the use of new techniques and best practices until W3C published them. **Therefore, W3C’s published techniques should not be required as the only way to meet WCAG 2 success criteria unless the limitations and consequences above are understood and acceptable.** For additional information, see: [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques) section of Understanding WCAG 2.1. ## Is ISO/IEC 40500 the same as WCAG 2.0? {#iso} **Yes.** WCAG 2.0 is approved as an ISO standard: ISO/IEC 40500:2012. ISO/IEC 40500 is exactly the same as the original Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 from the [W3C](http://www.w3.org/) Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/)). The content of ISO/IEC 40500 is freely available from [www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/); it is available for purchase from the [ISO catalogue {% include_cached external.html %}](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=58625). **For supporting resources that provide practical advice for meeting ISO/IEC 40500 (which is WCAG 2.0), see the [WCAG Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}).** The approval was announced 15 October 2012 in a [press release](http://www.w3.org/2012/07/wcag2pas-pr.html) and [blog post](http://www.w3.org/QA/2012/10/wcag_20_is_now_also_isoiec_405.html). If you want more information on W3C and the ISO process, see [W3C PAS FAQ](http://www.w3.org/2010/04/pasfaq). ### Benefits of WCAG as ISO Approval of WCAG 2.0 as an ISO standard benefits countries and organizations that can more easily adopt ISO standards. Countries that previously adapted WCAG 2.0 may now be able to *adopt WCAG 2.0 as is* by referencing ISO/IEC 40500. ### Translations {#isotranslations} W3C has offered our [WCAG 2.0 Authorized Translations]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/translations/\" | relative_url }}) to be used for the ISO/IEC translations. We will update this page when more information about translations is available. ## Is WCAG 2 available in other languages? {#languages} **Yes.** Authorized Translations and unofficial translations of the technical documents WCAG 2, Techniques for WCAG 2, and Understanding WCAG 2 are listed in [WCAG 2 Translations]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/translations/\" | relative_url }}). Unofficial translations of other WAI documents are listed at [Translations of W3C Documents - WAI documents - listed by languages](http://www.w3.org/2005/11/Translations/Query?lang=any&translator=any&date=any&docSelection=choose&rec=none&note=none&xg=none&tut=none&wai=any&i18n=none&qa=none&misc=none&sorting=byLanguage&output=FullHTML&submit=Submit) and [Translations of W3C Documents - WAI documents - listed by document](http://www.w3.org/2005/11/Translations/Query?lang=any&translator=any&date=any&docSelection=choose&rec=none&note=none&xg=none&tut=none&wai=any&i18n=none&qa=none&misc=none&sorting=byTechnology&output=FullHTML&submit=Submit).

[Techniques for WCAG 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/) has techniques for several different web technologies. *Note that publication of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all cases to create accessible content that meets WCAG 2.* Developers need to be aware of the limitations of specific technologies and ensure that they create content in a way that is accessible to all their potential users. WAI is also developing guidance on [Applying WCAG 2 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT)](http://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/). ## Where can I find answers to more of my questions? {#more} First, look through the documents on the W3C WAI website. WAI hosts an Interest Group (WAI IG) mailing list where the community discusses web accessibility issues. WAI IG provides ideas from different perspectives. If you have a question that might be relevant to the WAI IG list, you can: - Search the [WAI IG list archives](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/) to see if your question has already been addressed sufficiently. - Join the self-subscription list and post an appropriate question. Please read the [Using the WAI IG mailing list]({{ \"/about/groups/waiig/\" | relative_url }}#mailinglist) section of the WAI IG page. WAI staff are actively developing guidelines, technical reports, and supporting material, and generally are not available to answer individual questions. However, you can send questions to and we will integrate answers into this page and other documents as we are able.",

    "title": "Form field has non-empty accessible name",
    "text": "Rule Type: : atomic Rule ID: : e086e5 Last Modified: : Oct 1, 2020 Accessibility Requirements Mapping: : [4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value) - **Required for conformance** to WCAG 2.0 and later on level A and higher - [Outcome](#outcome) mapping: - Any `failed` outcomes: success criterion is not satisfied - All `passed` outcomes: success criterion needs further testing - An `inapplicable` outcome: success criterion needs further testing Input Aspects: : [Accessibility Tree](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-aspects/#input-aspects-accessibility) : [CSS styling](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-aspects/#input-aspects-css) : [DOM Tree](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-aspects/#input-aspects-dom) ## Description This rule checks that each form field element has a non-empty accessible name. ## Applicability This rule applies to any element that is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree), and that has one of the following [semantic roles][]: `checkbox`, `combobox` (`select` elements), `listbox`, `menuitemcheckbox`, `menuitemradio`, `radio`, `searchbox`, `slider`, `spinbutton`, `switch`, `textbox`. ## Expectation Each target element has an [accessible name][] that is not empty (`\"\"`). ## Assumptions _There are currently no assumptions_ ## Accessibility Support - Certain assistive technologies can be set up to ignore the title attribute, which means that to some users the title attribute will not act as an [accessible name][]. - Several assistive technologies have a functionality to list all form fields on a page, including the `disabled` ones. Therefore this rule is still applicable to `disabled` form fields. If an assistive technology consistently ignores `disabled` form fields in all its interactions, then it is possible to have a `disabled` form field with no accessible name without creating accessibility issues for the user. - Implementation of [Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][] varies from one browser or assistive technology to another. Depending on this, some elements can have one of the applicable [semantic roles][] and fail this rule with some technology but users of other technologies would not experience any accessibility issue. - Elements with the `option` role are not tested in this rule because they do not meet the definition of a [User interface component](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-user-interface-components). If these elements are presented as user interface components, these need to be tested separately from this rule. ## Background The list of roles in the applicability is derived by taking all the roles from [WAI-ARIA Specifications](#wai-aria-specifications) that: - have [semantic roles][] that inherit from the [abstract](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#abstract_roles) `input` or `select` role, and - do not have a [required context](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#scope) role that itself inherits from one of those roles. Note that this rule does not test other control-like roles such as `button` and `menuitem`, because these do not inherit from `input` or `select`. These should be tested separately. This rule does not map to [3.3.2 Labels or Instructions](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#labels-or-instructions) as there are sufficient techniques within 3.3.2 that don't need the elements to have an [accessible name][]. For example \"[G131: Providing descriptive labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G131)\" **AND** \"[G162: Positioning labels to maximize predictability of relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G162)\" would be sufficient. - [Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value) - [H91: Using HTML form controls and links](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H91) - [H44: Using label elements to associate text labels with form controls](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H44) - [H65: Using the title attribute to identify form controls when the label element cannot be used](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H65) ## Test Cases ### Passed #### Passed Example 1 This `input` element has an [accessible name][] because of its [programmatic label](#programmatic-label). ```html first name ``` #### Passed Example 2 This `input` element has an [accessible name][] because of its `aria-label` attribute. ```html last name ``` #### Passed Example 3 This `select` element has an [accessible name][] because of its [programmatic label](#programmatic-label). ```html Country England Scotland Wales Northern Ireland ``` #### Passed Example 4 This `textarea` element has an [accessible name][] because of its `aria-labelledby` attribute. ```html Country ``` #### Passed Example 5 This `input` element has an [accessible name][] because of its `placeholder` attribute. **Note**: While the `placeholder` attribute is sufficient to provide an [accessible name][], a [visible][] [label][] that does not disappear when a users starts to enter data is still required for [success criterion 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions][sc332]. ```html search ``` #### Passed Example 6 This element with a `combobox` [role][semantic role] has an [accessible name][] because of its `aria-label` attribute. ```html Country England ``` ### Failed #### Failed Example 1 This `input` element does not have an attribute that gives an [accessible name][] to it. ```html last name ``` #### Failed Example 2 This disabled `input` element does not have an attribute that gives an [accessible name][] to it. ```html ``` #### Failed Example 3 This `input` element has an empty (`\"\"`) [accessible name][] because the space in the `aria-label` [attribute value][] is trimmed. ```html ``` #### Failed Example 4 This `select` element has an empty (`\"\"`) [accessible name][] because the `div` has no text content. ```html England ``` #### Failed Example 5 This element with a `textbox` [role][semantic role] has an empty (`\"\"`) [accessible name][]. The parent `label` element does not give it an [accessible name][], this only works for native form fields. ```html first name ``` #### Failed Example 6 This element with a `textbox` [role][semantic role] has an empty (`\"\"`) [accessible name][]. The `label` element does not give it an [accessible name][], this only works for native form fields. ```html first name ``` ### Inapplicable #### Inapplicable Example 1 This `input` element is not [included in the accessibility tree][] because of its `style` attribute which sets `display` to `none`. ```html ``` #### Inapplicable Example 2 This `input` element is not [included in the accessibility tree][] because of its `aria-hidden` attribute. ```html ``` #### Inapplicable Example 3 This `select` element is not [included in the accessibility tree][] because it is `disabled` and has a `role` attribute value of \"presentation\". ```html Volvo Saab Opel ``` ## Glossary {% include_relative glossary/accessible-name.md %} {% include_relative glossary/attribute-value.md %} {% include_relative glossary/explicit-role.md %} {% include_relative glossary/focusable.md %} {% include_relative glossary/hidden-state.md %} {% include_relative glossary/implicit-role.md %} {% include_relative glossary/included-in-the-accessibility-tree.md %} {% include_relative glossary/marked-as-decorative.md %} {% include_relative glossary/outcome.md %} {% include_relative glossary/programmatic-label.md %} {% include_relative glossary/semantic-role.md %} {% include_relative glossary/visible.md %} {% include_relative glossary/wai-aria-specifications.md %} ## Acknowledgements This rule was written in the [ACT Rules community group](https://w3.org/community/act-r/), with the support of the EU-funded [WAI-Tools Project](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/projects/wai-tools/). ### Authors - [Anne Thyme Nørregaard](https://github.com/annethyme) - [Bryn Anderson](https://github.com/brynanders) ## Changelog This is the first version of this ACT rule.

Topics to Teach Topics to achieve the learning outcomes: {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: Controls and Labels {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Explain the use of HTML elements and, if necessary, WAI-ARIA attributes to provide form controls and labels for form controls. Demonstrate how these semantics benefit different users in different situations, such as people using screen readers, screen magnification, voice interaction, and other assistive technologies. Non-standard form controls are addressed in [Module 6: Custom Widgets]({{ \"/curricula/developer-modules/custom-widgets/\" | relative_url }}). #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * explain how assistive technologies, such as text-to-speech and voice interaction, associate labels with form controls and allow these to be used in different ways * explain how people with different disabilities benefit from form controls with clearly associated labels, for example to create larger activation areas for controls * write markup for form controls using native HTML elements, and additional WAI-ARIA attributes when necessary * identify the type of form control and use the corresponding HTML code to facilitate auto-complete * write markup to convey labels for form controls using the HTML element `label` and attribute `for` * identify situations in which it is necessary to use other techniques to provide labels for form controls, and mark up form controls using the following techniques as appropriate: * WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` * HTML element `title` * write code for groups of form controls using the HTML element `fieldset` and label such groups of form controls using the HTML element `legend` #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Provide examples of explicit and implicit associations using the `label` element. Explain that an implicit association can be achieved by wrapping the `label` element and its content around the form control. Explain explicit associations by means of the `for` attribute and indicate that its value must be a unique identifier of the form control that the label refers to. Explain the use of other explicit associations using the HTML attribute `title`, the WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby`. Explain that use of `placeholder` for labels should be avoided as its value disappears once the user has entered a value. Examples of how to label form controls are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Labeling controls](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/labels/). * Show examples of form controls that are related to each other, such as check boxes and radio buttons to select possible answers for a given question. Mention that the `fieldset` element is used to group them all, and that the `legend` element provides the label they share. Examples of how to group form controls are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Grouping controls](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/grouping/). * Invite students to navigate form controls using the keyboard only. Demonstrate the use of the tab key to move through different form controls. Demonstrate the use of the arrow keys to select options from combo boxes and lists. * Demonstrate the use of voice commands, keystrokes, and gestures provided by assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to navigate through form controls. Explore advanced functionality that some tools provide, such as presenting all form controls in a list where users can select the form control they are interested in. Examples of how people with disabilities interact with the Web are provided in [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/). * Demonstrate how people with mobility impairments or with low vision can click the label element to activate a specific form control if both are associated with each other. #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Short answer questions &mdash; Ask students to recite different ways to label form controls using HTML. Assess students' knowledge of the different HTML ways to label form controls. * Practical &mdash; Give students a group of form controls and ask students to provide their labels. Assess how students make use of the HTML element `label` together with the HTML attribute `for`, the HTML attribute `title`, and the WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-label`, and `aria-labelledby`. * Practical &mdash; Give students a set of radio buttons that allow to rate a piece of content based on stars, and a piece of text saying, \"Rate this\". Ask students to properly associate them with their overall label. Assess how students use the HTML elements `fieldset` and `legend`. * Practical &mdash; Ask students to activate a set of form controls by clicking their labels. Assess how students understand the relevance of proper click targets for people with mobility impairments. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: Instructions {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Explain how form instructions allow people to understand the purpose of form controls. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * write code to convey overall instructions for forms, and specific instructions for individual form controls and groups of form controls, so that they are clearly presented to all users, including through assistive technologies in *forms mode* * write code to convey required form controls using label text in addition to the HTML attribute `required` or the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-required` * describe shared requirements for content authors and designers to, whenever possible, provide: * clear and concise instructions for forms, form controls, and groups of form controls * overall instructions for forms before the forms, including each form in multi-step forms * specific instructions for individual form controls and groups of forms as part of the labels * information about the overall process and current step in the process, in multi-step forms * information about any time limits, and about stopping, adjusting, and extending time limits * information about ways that may be available to interrupt, save, and resume sessions #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Show examples of common instructions for form controls such as those related to allowed data formats, and general timing instructions. Explain that these instructions need to be provided before the form controls appear, so that they are clearly perceivable before initiating form completion. Examples of how to code general instructions for form controls are provided in the WAI tutorials, [Overall instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/instructions/#overall-instructions). * Show examples of additional instructions for form controls provided using the HTML attribute `title` or `placeholder`, or the WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby`. Mention that `title` and `placeholder` may not be well supported by some assistive technologies. Explain that the value of the `placeholder` disappears when the user enters a value, so essential instructions need to be provided using the other described methods. Emphasize that contents provided using WAI-ARIA are available for assistive technologies only and are not visible on screen. For examples of additional methods to provide labels for form controls, see technique [H65: Using the title attribute to identify form controls when the label  element cannot be used](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H65). Examples of how to provide in-line instructions for form controls are provided in the WAI tutorials, [In-line instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/instructions/#in-line-instructions). * Show examples of required form controls using the HTML attribute `required` and corresponding text added in the label. Explain why it is necessary to provide this information in multiple ways so that it is available to all users, rather than to rely on color alone or on the HTML semantics alone. #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practical &mdash; Give students overall instructions for a set of form controls such as the current and total number of steps of the form and ask students to code them appropriately. Assess students' knowledge of how to code overall instructions. * Practical &mdash; Give students in-line instructions for form controls such as examples of how data should be entered and ask students to code them appropriately. Assess students' knowledge of the different techniques to code in-line instructions. * Practical &mdash; Give students a set of form controls and ask students to code them so that they are required. Assess how students make use of the HTML attribute `required` and corresponding text in the label of the form control. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: Notifications {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Explain the use of HTML and WAI-ARIA to provide notifications about errors, successes, and other feedback resulting from interaction by the user. This includes feedback at the end of the process, such as submitting a form, and within the process, such as from validating input as the user types. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * describe shared requirements for content authors and designers to: * provide error and success messages when sessions and transactions are completed * provide clear feedback on the status of transition from one step of the process to another in multi-step forms * ensure that error and success messages that appear when forms are submitted are easy to perceive and understand by users * ensure that in-line error messages and other feedback that appears from user interaction with forms is clearly identifiable * provide warnings about any imminent time limits, and appropriate mechanisms to stop, adjust, or extend such time limits * allow users to check the entered data before finalizing transactions, or to undo transactions after submission * write code that supports perception of error and success messages that appear when forms are submitted; this includes reflecting these messages in the page title, main heading of the page, and modal dialogs as appropriate * write code that associates in-line feedback that appears from user interaction with the corresponding form controls; this includes using the control labels and the WAI-ARIA `aria-describedby` attribute * write code to convey instant feedback, such as that resulting from validating input from the user as it is being provided, using WAI-ARIA `aria-live` regions, and identify the appropriate priority values `polite`, `assertive`, and `off` for feedback * write code to convey alerts using WAI-ARIA `role=\"alert\"` and identify situations in which it is appropriate to interrupt users #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Introduce the different ways in which errors can be announced after form submission. Explain how warning messages can be included in the title of pages and their main headings, so that users are aware of the errors. Examples of how to communicate error messages are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Overall feedback](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/notifications/#overall-feedback). * Demonstrate the use of mechanisms to provide in-line error messages for form controls, such as using the HTML element `label` or the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-describedby`. Explain that programmatic associations help assistive technologies and adaptive strategies relate error messages to their specific field as users move around. Explain that WAI-ARIA live regions can be used to provide instant feedback as users are typing in a form control or as validation outputs appear so that people using screen readers can understand the information provided. Examples of how to code in-line error messages are provided in the WAI tutorials on [In-line feedback](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/notifications/#inline). * Demonstrate the use of some common HTML5 elements, such as `date`, `time`, `url`, `email`, and `pattern`. Explain that they allow users to enter data more reliably and help validation. Examples of how to validate common input are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Validating common input](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/validation/#validating-common-input). * Demonstrate the use of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-live` together with its values to indicate the priority with which updates are announced. For reference on the meaning of the different values of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-live`, see the WAI-ARIA specification, [`aria-live`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-live). * Explain the use of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-relevant` to communicate which changes of the region should be announced: additions, removals, or all. For reference on how to use `aria-relevant`, see the WAI-ARIA specification, [`aria-relevant`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-relevant). * Demonstrate the use of alert widgets such as a time warning and an error. Explain that these alerts may not be noticed while using assistive technologies, so additional markup is required. Examples of how to code these alerts are provided in the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices [Alert](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/alert/alert.html). * Show examples of mechanisms that allow to stop the time limit, such as a check box at the beginning of the form. For an example of how to provide these mechanisms, see techniques [G198: Providing a way for the user to turn the time limit off](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G198.html) and [G133: Providing a checkbox on the first page of a multipart form that allows users to ask for longer session time limit or no session time limit](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G133). * Show examples of mechanisms that allow to adjust time limits when they are about to expire. For examples of how to write code to adjust time limits, see technique [SCR16: Providing a script that warns the user a time limit is about to expire](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/client-side-script/SCR16.html). * Show examples of mechanisms that allow to extend time limits. Explain that they need to allow for extensions of up to 10 times the original time limit. For an example of a mechanism that allows to extend time limits, see technique [SCR1: Allowing the user to extend the default time limit](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/client-side-script/SCR1.html). #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practical &mdash; Give students a set of form control errors and ask students to provide a list of messages that explain such errors. Assess students' knowledge of how to group and communicate errors in a form control. * Practical &mdash; Give students a set of form controls with errors marked up using color alone. Then ask students to mark up these error messages using text in the vicinity of each of the form controls. Assess students' knowledge of how to associate form errors with their corresponding form control. * Practical &mdash; Give students a form submission containing errors. Then ask students to associate known corrections that may exist for the errors with each of the form controls. Assess students' understanding of how to associate known corrections with their corresponding form controls. * Practical &mdash; Give students a form control that outputs notifications as the user is typing to indicate the strength of a password and ask students to code accessible notifications. Assess students' knowledge of live regions to convey notifications. * Practical &mdash; Give students different types of alerts. Ask students to indicate their priority level and to code them appropriately.

However, as these elements are meant to provide a layer of isolation, the declared language of their [parent browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#parent-browsing-context) will likely not be inherited, making it possible for empty `lang` attributes in [nested browsing contexts](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#nested-browsing-context) to also cause accessibility issues. ## Expectation Each test target has a `lang` attribute that is neither empty (`\"\"`) nor only [ASCII whitespace](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-whitespace). ## Assumptions The language of the page can be set by other methods than the `lang` attribute, for example using HTTP headers or the `meta` element. These methods are not supported by all assistive technologies. This rule assumes that these other methods are insufficient to satisfying [Success Criterion 3.1.1: Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#language-of-page). ## Accessibility Support _There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._ ## Background - [Understanding Success Criterion 3.1.1: Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/language-of-page.html) - [H57: Using language attributes on the html element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H57) - [BCP 47: Tags for Identifying Languages](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) - [The `lang` and `xml:lang` attributes](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-lang-and-xml:lang-attributes) ## Test Cases ### Passed #### Passed Example 1 This `html` element has a `lang` attribute with a non-empty (`\"\"`) value. ```html ``` ### Failed #### Failed Example 1 This `html` element does not have a `lang` attribute. ```html ``` #### Failed Example 2 This `html` element has a `lang` attribute with an empty (`\"\"`) value. ```html ``` #### Failed Example 3 This `html` element has a `lang` attribute whose value is only [ASCII whitespace](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-whitespace). ```html ``` #### Failed Example 4 This `html` element has no `lang` attribute, only a `xml:lang` attribute. ```html ``` ### Inapplicable #### Inapplicable Example 1 This rule does not apply to `svg` element. ```svg ``` #### Inapplicable Example 2 This rule does not apply to `math` element. ```xml ``` ## Glossary {% include_relative glossary/outcome.md %} ## Acknowledgements This rule was written in the [ACT Rules community group](https://w3.org/community/act-r/), with the support of the EU-funded [WAI-Tools Project](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/projects/wai-tools/). ### Authors - [Jey Nandakumar](https://github.com/jkodu) ### Previous Authors - [Annika Nietzio](https://github.com/annika-FTB) ## Changelog This is the first version of this ACT rule.",

    "text": "Rule Type: : atomic Rule ID: : 5b7ae0 Last Modified: : Oct 6st, 2020 Accessibility Requirements Mapping: : [3.1.1 Language of Page (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#language-of-page) - **Required for conformance** to WCAG 2.0 and later on level A and higher - [Outcome](#outcome) mapping: - Any `failed` outcomes: success criterion is not satisfied - All `passed` outcomes: success criterion needs further testing - An `inapplicable` outcome: success criterion needs further testing Input Aspects: : [DOM Tree](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-aspects/#input-aspects-dom) ## Description This rule checks that both `lang` and `xml:lang` attributes on the root element of a non-embedded HTML page, have the same primary language subtag. ## Applicability This rule applies to any [document element](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#document-element) if it is an `html` element that: - is in a [top-level browsing context][]; and - has a [node document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-document) with a [content type][] of `text/html`; and - has a `lang` attribute that has a [valid language tag][]; and - has a non-empty `xml:lang` attribute. ## Expectation For each test target, the values of the [primary language subtags][], if any exist, for the `lang` and `xml:lang` attributes are the same. ## Assumptions - The language of the page can be set by other methods than the `lang` attribute, for example using HTTP headers or the `meta` element. These methods are not supported by all assistive technologies. This rule assumes that these other methods are insufficient to satisfying [Success Criterion 3.1.1: Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#language-of-page). - This rule assumes that user agents and assistive technologies can programmatically determine [valid language tags](#valid-language-tag) even if these do not conform to the [BCP 47][] syntax. - This rule assumes that [grandfathered tags][] are not used as these will not be recognized as [valid language tags](#valid-language-tag). - The rule assumes that having `lang` and `xml:lang` attributes with matching [primary language subtags][] but non-matching [language tags](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47#section-2) overall, will not cause accessibility issues. This is not necessarily the case for all languages. One notable case is the [language tags](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47#section-2) for Cantonese (`zh-yue`) and Mandarin (`zh-cmn`) where the [primary language subtags][] match, but the [extended language subtags][] don't. Such a case would not fail this rule, but could lead to accessibility issues. ## Accessibility Support Since most assistive technologies will consistently use `lang` over `xml:lang` when both are used, violation of this rule may not necessarily be a violation of WCAG 2. Only when there are inconsistencies between assistive technologies as to which attribute is used to determine the language does this lead to a violation of SC 3.1.1. ## Background This rule is only applicable to non-embedded HTML pages. HTML pages embedded into other documents, such as through `iframe` or `object` elements are not applicable because they are not [web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s) according to the definition in WCAG. - [H57: Using language attributes on the html element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H57) - [BCP 47: Tags for Identifying Languages](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) - [The `lang` and `xml:lang` attributes](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-lang-and-xml:lang-attributes) ## Test Cases ### Passed #### Passed Example 1 This `html` element has identical [primary language subtags][] for its `lang` and `xml:lang` attributes. ```html ``` #### Passed Example 2 This `html` element has identical [primary language subtags][] for its `lang` and `xml:lang` attributes.

This gives the button an empty [accessible name][]. ```html ``` ### Inapplicable #### Inapplicable Example 1 The `button` element is not an image button. [Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-content) can not fail text buttons. Only non-text content is applicable. ```html My button ``` #### Inapplicable Example 2 The `input` element with type with a `type` attribute in the `Button` state is not an image button. [Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-content) can not fail text buttons. Only non-text content is applicable. ```html ``` #### Inapplicable Example 3 The `button` element is tested separately from the `img` element. [Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value) is applied to the button, whereas the image is tested under [Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-content) ```html ``` #### Inapplicable Example 4 The `img` element is not a user interface component, and so is not tested for [Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value). ```html ``` #### Inapplicable Example 5 The image button is ignored by assistive technologies because it is not [included in the accessibility tree][]. These are not required to have an accessible name. If at some future state of the page the element gets [included in the accessibility tree][], an [accessible name][] will be necessary. ```html ``` ## Glossary ### Accessible Name The programmatically determined name of a user interface element that is [included in the accessibility tree](#included-in-the-accessibility-tree). The accessible name is calculated using the [accessible name and description computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname). For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional information on how to calculate the accessible name can be found in [HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0, Accessible Name and Description Computation (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/#accessible-name-and-description-computation) and [SVG Accessibility API Mappings, Name and Description (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/#mapping_additional). **Note**: As per the [accessible name and description computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname), each element always has an accessible name. When no accessible name is provided, the element will nonetheless be assigned an empty (`\"\"`) one. **Note**: As per the [accessible name and description computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname), accessible names are [flat string](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#terminology) trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace. Notably, it is not possible for a non-empty accessible name to be composed only of whitespace since these must be trimmed. #### Accessibility Support - Because the [accessible name and description computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname) is not clear about which whitespace are considered, browsers behave differently when trimming and flattening the accessible name. For example, some browsers completely trim non-breaking spaces while some keep them in the accessible name. - There exists a popular browser which does not perform the same trimming and flattening depending whether the accessible name comes from content, an `aria-label` attribute, or an `alt` attribute. - There exists a popular browser which assign no accessible name (`null`) when none is provided, instead of assigned an empty accessible name (`\"\"`). #### Examples **Note**: The examples presented here are non-normative and not testable. They serve to illustrate some common pitfalls about the definition and to help implementers of ACT rules understand it. The `input` elements have an accessible name of, respectively, \"Billing Name\" and \"Billing Address\". These accessible names are given by the `aria-labelledby` attributes and associated elements. ```html Billing Name Address ``` This `button` element has an accessible name of \"Share ACT rules\" given by its `aria-label` attribute. ```html Share ``` This `img` element has an accessible name of \"ACT rules\" given by its `alt` attribute. ```html ``` The `button` element has an accessible name of \"Share ACT rules\" given by the enclosing `label` element (implicit `label`) ```html Share ACT rulesShare ``` The `button` element has an accessible name of \"Share ACT rules\" given by the associated `label` element (explicit `label`) ```html Share ACT rules ``` This `a` element has an accessible name of \"ACT rules\" given from its content. Note that not all [semantic roles](#semantic-role) allow [name from content](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#namefromcontent). ```html ACT rules ``` This `span` element has an empty accessible name (`\"\"`) because `span` does not allow [name from content](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#namefromcontent). ```html ACT rules ``` This `span` element has an empty accessible name (`\"\"`) because `span` is not a [labelable element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#category-label). ```html ACT rules ``` **Note**: When the same element can have an accessible name from several sources, the order of precedence is: `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label`, own attributes, `label` element, name from content. The examples here are listed in the same order. **Note**: For more examples of accessible name computation, including many tricky cases, check the [Accessible Name Testable Statements](https://www.w3.org/wiki/AccName_1.1_Testable_Statements). ### Included In The Accessibility Tree Elements included in the accessibility tree of platform specific accessibility APIs. Elements in the accessibility tree are exposed to assistive technologies, allowing users to interact with the elements in a way that meet the requirements of the individual user. The general rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree are defined in the [core accessibility API mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam/). For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree can be found in the [HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/) and the [SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/). > **Note:** Users of assistive technologies might still be able to interact with elements that are not included in the accessibility tree. An example of this is a [focusable](#focusable) element with an `aria-hidden` attribute with a value of `true`. Such an element could still be interacted with using sequential keyboard navigation regardless of the assistive technologies used, even though the element would not be included in the accessibility tree. #### Examples **Note**: The examples presented here are non-normative and not testable. They serve to illustrate some common pitfalls about the definition and to help implementers of ACT rules understand it. This `span` element is included in the accessibility tree (by default, elements are included in the accessibility tree). ```html ACT rules ``` This `span` element is not included in the accessibility tree because it is hidden to everybody by the CSS property. ```html ACT rules ``` This `span` element is not included in the accessibility tree because it is explicitly removed by the `aria-hidden` attribute. ```html ACT rules ``` This `span` element is positioned off screen, hence is not [visible](#visible), but is nonetheless included in the accessibility tree. ```html ACT rules ``` Although the `span` element with an `id` of \"label\" is not itself included in the accessibility tree, it still provides an [accessible name](#accessible-name) to the other `span`, via the `aria-labelledby` attribute. Thus, it is still indirectly exposed to users of assistive technologies. Removing an element from the accessibility tree is not enough to remove all accessibility concerns from it since it can still be indirectly exposed. ```html ACT rules Accessibility Conformance Testing rules ``` Although this `input` element is not included in the accessibility tree, it is still [focusable](#focusable), hence users of assistive technologies can still interact with it by sequential keyboard navigation. This may result in confusing situations for such users (and is in direct violation of [the fourth rule of ARIA (working draft)](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#fourth)). ```html ``` ### Outcome A conclusion that comes from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) or one of its constituent [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). An outcome can be one of the three following types: - **Inapplicable:** No part of the test subject matches the applicability - **Passed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) meets all expectations - **Failed:** A [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target) does not meet all expectations **Note:** A rule has one `passed` or `failed` outcome for every [test target](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target). When there are no test targets the rule has one inapplicable outcome. This means that each [test subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject) will have one or more outcomes. **Note:** Implementers using the [EARL10-Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed`, `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such \"interim\" results can be expressed with the incomplete outcome. ### Whitespace Characters that have the Unicode \"White_Space\" property in the [Unicode properties list](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/PropList.txt). This includes: - all characters in the [Unicode Separator categories](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/ch04.pdf#G134153), and - the following characters in the [Other, Control](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/ch04.pdf#G134153) category: - Character tabulation (`U+0009`) - Line Feed (LF) (`U+000A`) - Line Tabulation (`U+000B`) - Form Feed (FF) (`U+000C`) - Carriage Return (CR) (`U+000D`) - Next Line (NEL) (`U+0085`) ## Acknowledgements ### Authors This rule was written in the [ACT Rules community group](https://w3.org/community/act-r/), by: - [Anne Thyme Nørregaard](https://github.com/annethyme) Developed with the support of the EU-funded [WAI-Tools Project](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/projects/wai-tools/).

[Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][] does not specify what to do if such an image is [focusable][] (it only specifies what to do in case of explicit `role=\"none\"` or `role=\"presentation\"`). Some browsers expose these images and some don't. Thus, this rule may fail for technologies that expose these without creating an accessibility issue for users of other technologies. ## Background - [Understanding Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content.html) - [G94: Providing short text alternative for non-text content that serves the same purpose and presents the same information as the non-text content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G94) - [G95: Providing short text alternatives that provide a brief description of the non-text content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G95) - [H37: Using alt attributes on img elements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H37) - [ARIA6: Using aria-label to provide labels for objects](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA6) - [ARIA10: Using aria-labelledby to provide a text alternative for non-text content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA10) - [H67: Using null alt text and no title attribute on img elements for images that AT should ignore](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H67) - [F38: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to not marking up decorative images in HTML in a way that allows assistive technology to ignore them](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/failures/F38) - [F65: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to omitting the alt attribute or text alternative on img elements, area elements, and input elements of type \"image\"](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/failures/F65) ## Test Cases ### Passed #### Passed Example 1 This HTML `img` element has an [accessible name][] because of the `alt` attribute. ```html ``` #### Passed Example 2 This element with a [semantic role][] of `img` has an [accessible name][] because of the `aria-label` attribute. ```html ``` #### Passed Example 3 This element with a [semantic role][] of `img` has an [accessible name][] because of an `aria-labelledby` attribute and an element with matching `id`. ```html W3C logo ``` #### Passed Example 4 This `img` element has an [accessible name][] because of a `title` attribute. **Note**: There are assistive technologies that do not support using the `title` attribute for an [accessible name][], or in which this feature can be disabled. ```html ``` #### Passed Example 5 This `img` element has an [implicit role][] of `presentation` because of the empty `alt` attribute. ```html ``` #### Passed Example 6 This `img` element has an [explicit role][] of `presentation` because of the value of the `role` attribute. ```html ``` #### Passed Example 7 This `img` element has an [explicit role][] of `none` because of the value of the `role` attribute. ```html ``` #### Passed Example 8 This off screen `img` element has an [implicit role][] of `presentation` because of the empty `alt` attribute. ```html ``` ### Failed #### Failed Example 1 This `img` element has an empty [accessible name][] and an [implicit role][] of `img` because it is missing an `alt` attribute. ```html ``` #### Failed Example 2 This element with role of `img` has an empty [accessible name][]. ```html ``` #### Failed Example 3 This `img` element inside a `div` positioned off screen has an empty [accessible name][] and an [implicit role][] of `img`. ```html ``` #### Failed Example 4 This `img` element has an empty [accessible name][] because the space in the `alt` attribute is trimmed off by the [accessible name computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/). Because of the space, the `alt` attribute is not empty (`\"\"`) which gives the element the [implicit role][] of `img`. ```html ``` #### Failed Example 5 This `img` element has an [explicit role][] of `none`. However, it is [focusable][] due to the `tabindex` attribute. Because of this it has a [semantic role][] of `img` due to [Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][]. It does not have an accessible name. ```html ``` ### Inapplicable #### Inapplicable Example 1 This `svg` element has an [implicit role][] of `graphics-document`. ```html ``` #### Inapplicable Example 2 This element with a [semantic role][] of `img` is hidden with `aria-hidden` set to \"true\". ```html ``` #### Inapplicable Example 3 This `img` element is hidden with `aria-hidden` set to \"true\". ```html ``` #### Inapplicable Example 4 This `img` element is hidden because its parent has `display: none`. ```html ``` #### Inapplicable Example 5 This `img` element is hidden with `visibility: hidden`. ```html ``` ## Glossary {% include_relative glossary/accessible-name.md %} {% include_relative glossary/explicit-role.md %} {% include_relative glossary/focusable.md %} {% include_relative glossary/hidden-state.md %} {% include_relative glossary/implicit-role.md %} {% include_relative glossary/included-in-the-accessibility-tree.md %} {% include_relative glossary/marked-as-decorative.md %} {% include_relative glossary/outcome.md %} {% include_relative glossary/semantic-role.md %} {% include_relative glossary/wai-aria-specifications.md %} ## Acknowledgements This rule was written in the [ACT Rules community group](https://w3.org/community/act-r/), with the support of the EU-funded [WAI-Tools Project](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/projects/wai-tools/). ### Authors - [Wilco Fiers](https://github.com/wilcofiers) ### Previous Authors - [Anne Thyme Nørregaard](https://github.com/annethyme) - [Stein Erik Skotkjerra](https://github.com/skotkjerra) ## Changelog This is the first version of this ACT rule.

Explain how text alternatives can be presented in different ways, for example visually in different text sizes, through text-to-speech, as braille, and as symbols. Explain different coding techniques to provide text alternatives for images. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * explain how text alternatives for images are processed by assistive technologies and how they can be presented to people with disabilities in different ways, such as text, text-to-speech, braille, and symbols * identify images that convey information, including images of text, versus images that are purely decorative * write markup for informative images using the HTML attributes `alt` and `title`, and WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby`, and describe how these attributes are processed by assistive technologies to provide text alternatives * write markup for decorative images using empty text alternatives and using CSS so that they are ignored by assistive technologies * describe related requirements for content authors to provide short text alternatives for informative images #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Explain that the HTML attribute `alt` should contain concise and clear information about the image. State why it is not necessary to include the word \"image\" in the text alternative because the HTML element `img` is already announced by assistive technologies. Mention that decorative images should have empty (\"\") values in the `alt` attributes, or that they should be included in the web page using CSS instead, so that they are ignored by assistive technologies. Examples of how to use `alt` to code text alternatives are provided in techniques [H2: Combining adjacent image and text links for the same resource](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H2) and [H37: Using alt attributes on `img` elements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H37). * Demonstrate other ways to provide text alternatives, such as the HTML attribute `title` and WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby`. Explain that these may not be well supported by older browsers and assistive technologies. Examples of how to use `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` to provide descriptions for images are provided in techniques [ARIA6: Using aria-label to provide labels for objects](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA6.html) and [ARIA10: Using aria-labelledby to provide a text alternative for non-text content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA10.html). * Show different examples of informative images (including images of text) and contrast them with decorative images. Explain how context can affect the meaning of the same image. Emphasize how each context may require a different text alternative, including an empty text alternative when the image is decorative. Descriptions of informative and decorative images are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Decorative Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/) and [Informative Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/informative/). #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Short Answer Questions &mdash; Ask students about the different HTML and WAI-ARIA elements and attributes to provide text alternatives for images. Assess students' knowledge of the different coding techniques to provide text alternatives for images. * Practical &mdash; Students provide text alternatives for a given set of informative and decorative images. Assess how students relate a given image with its specific function within a website. * Practical &mdash; Give students the same image in different contexts and ask students to provide the corresponding text alternative for each. Assess how students consider the context of an image to provide its text alternative. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: Functional Images {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Explain why images that indicate functionality, such as images in links and buttons, require text alternatives that describe the purpose of the function rather than to describe the image itself. Explain how the text alternative depends on the context of the image, such as any adjacent text. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * write text alternatives for button images and image input types that describe the action these images are carrying out * write text alternatives for images in links that, along with any adjacent link text, describe the action the links are carrying out * write text alternatives that are consistent across the content so that the same function is recognized when it is placed in different places of the content * write markup for functional images using the HTML attributes `alt` and `title`, and WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby`, and describe how these attributes are processed by assistive technologies to provide text alternatives #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Explain that functional images serve to initiate an action, rather than to convey information. An explanation of functional images is provided in the WAI tutorials on [Images Concepts](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/). * Show examples of button and image input types, such as those for printing and saving a document. Explain that their text alternatives need to refer to the action that the image conveys. Examples of several text alternatives for functional images are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Functional Images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/functional/). * Show examples of adjacent link and button texts that may influence the text alternative for a functional image. Explain that when the adjacent text conveys the action performed by the image, a null text alternative should be provided. #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Short Answer Questions &mdash; Ask students what a functional image is. Assess students' knowledge of what a functional image is. * Practical &mdash; Give students functional images with and without surrounding text and ask students to provide text alternatives accordingly. Assess how students provide text alternatives for functional images based on context. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: Complex Images {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Explain that complex images, such as charts, diagrams, and infographics, provide rich information and require longer text alternatives to describe them. Discuss mechanisms to provide additional descriptions for complex images, including providing these descriptions for everyone directly in the content. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * write markup for additional descriptions for images using one of the following techniques: * HTML elements `figure` and `figcaption` (and HTML attribute `alt` when individual images require specific descriptions) * WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-describedby` * HTML attribute `longdesc` (in certain contexts, such as ePub) * style text using CSS Transforms and CSS Fonts instead of using images of text * write code to update text alternatives when images are changed dynamically, including animations * explain how to provide accessible charts, diagrams, and infographics by using SVG instead of non-scalable images * explain how to provide accessible mathematical expressions by using MathML instead of using images of text * describe related requirements for designers to provide charts, diagrams, and infographics that are easy to understand * describe related requirements for authors to write meaningful text alternatives for textual and complex images #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Explain ways to provide additional descriptions for complex images and groups of images such as charts, diagrams, and screen shots of materials that are intended to be read as text. For example, the HTML elements `figure` and `figcaption`, the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-describedby` and the HTML attribute `longdesc`. Explain that the `alt` attribute may be also advised if there are individual images within those groups of images that require specific descriptions. Mention that `longdesc` may not be well supported by some browsers and assistive technologies. Examples of how to describe complex images are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Complex images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/complex/) and [images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/textual/). * Discuss how working with the content authors and designers can often lead to simpler ways of communicating the information for everyone. Also discuss how descriptions for complex images benefit many people, so that providing these descriptions directly in the content is often more beneficial than providing these as text alternatives for users of assistive technologies only. * Demonstrate how SVG can be used to provide graphics, including animations. Discuss the support for SVG in browsers and assistive technologies, as well as authoring tools to create such graphics. Explain the benefits of graphics provided as SVG, which allows them to be resized without pixelating, allows text and objects within the image to be accessed by assistive technologies, and allows the presentation to be customized. * Demonstrate how MathML can be used to code mathematical expressions. Emphasize that screen reader support for MathML is growing, but others may need additional browser extensions to access contents in MathML. Examples of how to use the MathML language to code mathematical expressions are provided in the WAI tutorials on [mathematical expressions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/textual/#mathematical-expressions). * Demonstrate that many visual effects can now be achieved by using CSS Transforms and CSS Fonts, instead of using images of text. Explain the benefits of using real text, which can be resized and adapted, as opposed to images that do not support such uses. Examples of how to use CSS3 properties to style text decorations are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Using CSS](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/textual/#using-css3). #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practical &mdash; Ask students to code descriptions for a set of given charts and graphics. Assess how students code descriptions for complex images. * Practical &mdash; Give students a set of images of text and ask students to code them using CSS Transforms and CSS Fonts. Assess students' knowledge of CSS Transforms and CSS Font technologies. * Practical &mdash; Give students charts, diagrams, and infographics and ask students to code them using SVG, providing descriptions as appropriate. Assess students' knowledge of how to code graphics using SVG and how to provide their descriptions when necessary. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"all\" %} ## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practical &mdash; Supervise students using mechanisms that assistive technologies provide to move to next and previous image and to show all the images of a web page in an isolated list. Assess students’ knowledge of mechanisms of assistive technologies to move through images. * Guided Quiz &mdash; Give students a set of images in the context of a website and ask students to provide their type and possible text alternative. Assess how students identify different types of images and provide text alternatives based on their purpose and context. * Portfolio &mdash; Students add different types of images to the website they are building. Assess how students code images and how they provide text alternatives based on their knowledge or with the help of other roles. ## Teaching Resources Suggested resources to support your teaching: * [Images (WAI Web Accessibility Tutorials)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/) &mdash; Shows how to provide alternatives to images that are accessible to people with disabilities. * [How People with Disabilities Use the Web]({{ \"/people-use-web/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; Provides stories of people with disabilities using the Web; describes types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies that some people use. * [Video Captions (Web Accessibility Perspectives)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/captions/) &mdash; Is one of the Web accessibility perspectives videos that show accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities. * [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) &mdash; Address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. * [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) &mdash; Describes the roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements and can be used to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications. * [HTML5 living standard {% include_cached icon.html name=\"external-link\" %}](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) &mdash; The core markup language for the web. * [CSS Specifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS). * [SVG](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/)",

[شادي يتحدث] على سبيل المثال، شخص لا يملك استخدام ذراعيه ويستخدم مقبض للكتابة بالفم. شخص يستخدم عصا الفم للكتابة أو شخص لا يسمع جيدا يستخدم الترجمات لمشاهدة أشرطة الفيديو. شخص يستخدم جهاز السمع شخص لا يرى جيدا يستخدم قارئ الشاشة لنطق ما يحدث على الشاشة بصوت عال. شخص يستخدم قارئ الشاشة للولوجيات فوائد عديدة. [شادي يتحدث] على سبيل المثال، الترجمات تفيد أي شخص في محيط ضاج أو في محيط هادئ. شخص في مكتب يشاهد فيديو مع تسميات توضيحية وتباين الألوان جيد هوأفضل في حالة الضوء الساطع. شخص ينظر إلى الهاتف المحمول مع انعكاسات على الشاشة يستفيد أيضا الشخص الذي يعاني من تدهور مرتبط بالسن، مثل الانخفاض في البراعة. شخص يرتعش يستخدام الماوس بصعوبة في الواقع، تصميم ونصق أحسن يعزز تجربة مستخدم للجميع. شخصان يبتسمان بسعادة على موقع جيد التصميم يمكن إنشاء الكثير من الولوجيات في الشفرة الأساسية لمواقع الويب والتطبيقات. [شادي يتحدث] تكنولوجيات الويب لدى W3C، مثل HTML، تراعي للعديد من ميزات الولوجيات. شفرة HTML لصفحة ويب على سبيل المثال، ميزات لتوفير نص بديل للصور، والذي يتم نطقه بصوت عال من قبل قراء الشاشة، ويستخدم أيضا من قبل محركات البحث. مثال لشفرة كما أن العناوين والتسميات وغيرها من العلامات تراعي للولوجية وتحسن الجودة الشاملة. مثال لشفرة أدوات التأليف الجيدة، مثل الويكي وإدارة المحتوى، وتحرير الشفرات، تساعد على إنشاء شفرة ولوجية بشكل تلقائي أو بمساهمة المؤلف. مثال أداة التأليف المستخدمة لإنشاء محتوى الويب كما يجب على متصفحات الويب ومشغلات الوسائط والتطبيقات مراعاة ميزات الولوجية. مثال متصفح ويب يُستخدم لعرض محتوى الويب ‏W3C يوفر معايير ليساعد في جعل الويب ولوجي، و التي هي معترف بها دوليا من طرف الحكومات والشركات. [شادي يتحدث] والأكثر شهرة هي المبادئ التوجيهية لولوجية محتوى الويب - WCAG. و هي أيضا معيار ISO رقم 40500، واعتمدت في المعيار الأوروبي المسمىِ EN 301 549. وهي مبنية على أربعة مبادئ رئيسية : المبادئ التوجيهية لولوجية محتوى الويب - WCAG؛ ISO 40500؛ EN 301 549 أولا الإسْتيعاب. يجب القدرة على رؤية المحتوى أو السماع اليه مثلا. يكتب البعض على الجهاز اللوحي ويستمع إليه مع سماعات الرأس وقابلية التشغيل. يمكن استخدام الكمبيوتر عن طريق لوحة المفاتيح أو عن طريق الصوت مثلا. يتحدث البعض إلى الجهاز اللوحي ويمكن فهمه. يجب استعمال أسلوب واضح وبسيط مثلا. شخصان يظهران في حيرة من شاشة الكمبيوتر مع موقع ويب كثيف وقوي. حتى نتمكن من استخدام مختلف تقنيات المساعدة. شخص يستخدم تكبير الشاشة على كمبيوتر ذو شاشة كبيرة بالإضافة إلى WCAG، يوفر W3C أيضا المبادئ التوجيهية لولوجية أدوات التأليف - ATAG، التي تحدد المتطلبات لأنظمة إدارة المحتوى، وتحرير الشفرات وغيرها من البرامج. المبادئ التوجيهية لولوجية أدوات التأليف - ATAG والمبادئ التوجيهية لولوجية عميل المستخدم - UAAG تحدد المتطلبات لمتصفحات الويب ومشغلات الوسائط. المبادئ التوجيهية لولوجية عميل المستخدم - UAAG هناك أكثر من مليار شخص لديهم إعاقة، أو حوالي 15-20٪ من السكان. اتفاقية الأمم المتحدة لحقوق الأشخاص ذوي الإعاقة تنص على أن الولوج إلى المعلومة، بما في ذلك شبكة الويب، هو حق من حقوق الإنسان. وقد صادقت معظم بلدان العالم على اتفاقية الأمم المتحدة هذه، واعتمد العديد منهم سياسات ملزمة في هذا الشأن. وبغض النظر عن أي قوانين ومراسيم، فإن إدراج معايير الولوجيات هو أمر أساسي للأشخاص ذوي الإعاقة، وهو مفيد للجميع.

Pokud jsou však webové stránky, aplikace, technologie nebo nástroje špatně navrženy, mohou vytvářet bariéry, které zabraňují lidem v používání webu. **Přístupnost je nezbytná pro vývojáře a organizace, kteří chtějí produkovat vysoce kvalitní webové stránky a webové nástroje a nezabraňovat lidem v používání jejich produktů a služeb.** ## Co je webová přístupnost {#what} Webová přístupnost znamená, že webové stránky, nástroje a technologie jsou navržené a vyvinuté tak, že lidé se zdravotním postižením je mohou používat. Konkrétněji, lidé mohou: - vnímat, rozumět, navigovat a interagovat s webem - přispívat na web Webová přístupnost zahrnuje všechna postižení, která mají vliv na přístup k webu, včetně postižení: - sluchových - kognitivních - neurologických - fyzických - řečových - zrakových Webová přístupnost je přínosná také pro osoby *bez* postižení, například: - osoby, které používají mobilní telefony, chytré hodinky, chytré televize a další přístroje s malými obrazovkami, různými vstupními režimy apod. - starší osoby, jejichž schopnosti se mění s věkem - osoby s \"dočasným postižením\" jako třeba zlomenou rukou nebo ztracenými brýlemi - osoby v \"limitujících situacích\" jako třeba na přímém slunci nebo v prostředí, kde nemohou poslouchat zvuk - osoby s pomalým připojením k internetu nebo s omezenými nebo drahými daty Pro sedmiminutové video s příklady, jak je přístupnost nezbytná pro lidi s postižením a užitečná pro všechny v různých situacích, navštivte: {% include video-link.html title=\"Video o perspektivách webové přístupnosti (YouTube)\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f31oufqFSM\" src=\"/content-images/wai-intro-accessibility/video-still-accessibility-perspectives-16-9.jpg\" %} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"3\" title=\"Více informací o tom, co je přístupnost\" class=\"simple aside\" %} {:/} - Pokud chcete zjistit více o tom, jak různá zdravotní postižení ovlivňují používání webu, navštivte [Jak lidé s postižením používají web (anglicky)]({{ \"/people-use-web/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}. - Pro více příkladů výhod pro ostatní, podložených WCAG, navštivte [Sdílené zkušenosti na webu: Bariéry společné pro uživatele mobilních telefonů a osoby s postižením (anglicky)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/shared-experiences/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} a archivované [výhody webové přístupnost pro lidi s postižením i bez](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/archive/soc#groups). {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Přístupnost je důležitá pro jednotlivce, podniky, společnost {#important} Web se stává stále důležitějších zdrojem v mnoha oblastech života: vzdělání, zaměstnání, vládě, obchodu, zdravotnictví, rekreaci a dalších. Je zásadní, aby web byl přístupný a poskytoval rovnocenný přístup a rovné příležitosti lidem s různými schopnostmi. Přístup k informačním a komunikačním technologiím, včetně webu, je definován jako základní lidské právo v konvenci Spojených národů O právech osob se zdravotním postižením (UN [CRPD](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html)). Web nabízí možnost bezprecedentního přístupu k informacím a interakcím pro mnoho lidí se zdravotním postižením. To znamená, že bariéry přístupnosti v tisku, audio a vizuálních médiích lze snadno překonat pomocí webových technologií. Přístupnost podporuje sociální začleňování osob se zdravotním postižením i ostatních, například: - starších osob - osob v odlehlých oblastech - osob v rozvojových zemích **Přístupnost má také zásadní ekonomický význam.** Jak je vysvětleno v předchozích sekcích, přístupný design vylepšuje celkový uživatelský prožitek a spokojenost, zejména v různých situacích, s různými zařízeními a pro starší uživatele. Přístupnost může vylepšit Vaši značku, řídit inovace a zvětšit Váš dosah na trhu.

Jednuduché kroky, jako třeba změna nastavení v prohlížeči, Vám mohou pomoci zhodnotit některé aspekty přístupnosti. Komplexní zhodnocení toho, zda Vaše webová stránka splňuje všechny pokyny pro přístupnost, vyžaduje více úsilí. Existují nástroje, které pomáhají s hodnocením. Žádný nástroj však sám nemůže určit, zda stránka splňuje všechny pokyny pro přístupnost. K určení, zda je web skutečně přístupný, je třeba informované lidské zhodnocení. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"3\" title=\"Více informací o Hodnocení přístupnosti\" class=\"simple aside\" %} {:/} - Zdroje, které pomáhají s hodnocením přístupnosti, jsou popsány v [Hodnocení přístupnosti webových stránek (anglicky)]({{ \"/test-evaluate/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"examples\" %} ## Příklady {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} ### Textové alternativy obrázků ![obrázek loga, HTML kód pro obrázek s alternativním textem Logo Iniciativy pro přístupnost webu'](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/alt-logo.png){:.right} Obrázky by měly obsahovat *[ekvivalentní textové alternativy](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv.html)* (alt text) v kódu. Pokud není poskytnuta textová alternativa obrázku, obrázek není přístupný například pro lidi, kteří nevidí a používají čtečku obrazovky. Ta čte nahlas informace na stránce, včetně textových alternativ pro obrázky. Pokud je poskytnutá textová alternativa obrázku, informace je přístupná pro slepé osoby, stejně jako pro osoby, které mají vypnuté zobrazení obrázků (například v oblastech s drahým nebo pomalým připojením). Informace je také dostupná pro technologie, které obrázky nevidí, jako třeba vyhledávače. ### Přístupnost z klávesnice ![přeškrtnutá myš](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/no-mouse.png){:.left width=\"67\" height=\"45\"} Někteří lidé nemohou používat myš, včetně starších osob s omezenou jemnou motorikou.

Jedná se o grafické prohlížeče pro PC, hlasové prohlížeče, mobilní prohlížeče, přehrávače multimédií, pluginy a některé [kompenzační pomůcky (anglicky)]({{ \"/people-use-web/tools-techniques/\" | relative_url }}#at \"definition\"){: hreflang=\"en\"}. - **Vývojové nástroje**{:#authoringtools} - software nebo služby, které se používají k tvorbě webového obsahu, včetně editorů kódu, nástrojů pro převod dokumentů, systémů pro správu obsahu, blogů, databázových skriptů a dalších. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Další informace o standardech webové přístupnosti {:.no_toc} {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Výše zmíněné komponenty jsou propojeny a vzájemně se podporují. Například **webový obsah** musí zahrnovat textové alternativy pro obrázky. Tato informace musí být zpracována **webovými prohlížeči** a předána **asistenčním technologiím**, například čtečkám obrazovky. Autoři potřebují **vývojové nástroje**, které jim umožní tvorbu těchto textových alternativ. Více informací je v [Základních komponentech webové přístupnosti (anglicky)]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}. Standardy hrají zásadní roli v definování požadavků na přístupnost pro každý z těchto komponentů. Splnění některých požadavků na přístupnost je jednoduché, přesto porozumnění základům, jak osoby se zdravotním postižením používají Web, pomáhá tyto požadavky splnit efektivněji. Některé aspekty přístupnosti vyžadují více technických dovedností nebo pokročilé znalosti toho, jak lidé používají Web. V každém případě [zapojení uživatelů ze začátku a během projektů (anglicky)]({{ \"/test-evaluate/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} zlepší a usnadní vaši práci. Iniciativa pro webovou přístupnost W3C (WAI) poskytuje soubor pokynů, které jsou mezinárodně uznávány jako standard pro webovou přístupnost. Jedná se o: - **[Pokyny pro zpřístupnění obsahu webu (WCAG) (anglicky)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}** - **[Pokyny k uživatelským agentům (UAAG) (anglicky)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/uaag/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}** - **[Pokyny pro zpřístupnění vývojových nástrojů (ATAG) (anglicky)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/atag/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}** K dispozici jsou také WAI specifikace pro **[Přístupné internetové aplikace (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php)**, které zahrnují dynamický obsah a pokročilé ovládací prvky uživatelského rozhraní vyvinuté s použitím Ajaxu, JavaScriptu a souvisejících webových technologií. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} ## Vnímatelné informace a uživatelské rozhraní {#perceivable} ### Textové alternativy pro netextový obsah {#alternatives} Textové alternativy jsou ekvivalenty pro netextový obsah. Mezi příklady patří: - Krátké alternativy pro obrázky, včetně ikon, tlačítek a grafického obsahu - Popis dat znázorněných v grafech, diagramech a ilustracích - Krátký popis netextového obsahu jako audio a video souborů - Popisky pro ovládací prvky formulářů, vstupů a dalších komponent uživatelského rozhraní Textové alternativy vyjadřují význam obrázku nebo pomáhají poskytnout srovnatelný uživatelský prožitek. Například vhodná textová alternativa pro tlačítko vyhledávání je \"*vyhledat*\", ne \"*lupa*\". Textové alternativy lze prezentovat různými způsoby. Například mohou být nahlas přečteny pro uživatele, kteří nevidí obrazovku a pro lidi s obtížemi při čtení. Mohou být zvětšeny na vlastní velikost textu nebo zobrazeny na braillských zařízeních. Textové alternativy slouží jako popisky pro ovládácí prvky a funkce pro usnadnění navigace pomocí klávesnice a navigace pomocí rozpoznávání hlasu (hlasový vstup). Také slouží jako popisky pro audio, video a další formáty.

Příklady takového obsahu jsou: - Barva není jediný nositel informace nebo identifikátor obsahu - Výchozí kombinace barvy popředí a pozadí má dostatečný barevný kontrast - Pokud uživatel zvětší text na 400% nebo změní velikost řádkování, žádné informace nejsou ztraceny - Přeformátování textu v malých oknech („výřezech“) a při zvětšení textu uživatelem - U obrázků textu lze změnit velikost. Lepší je ale nahradit je textem nebo se jim pokud možno vyhnout - Uživatel může pozastavit, zastavit nebo změnit hlasitost zvuku, který hraje na webové stránce - Audio na pozadí je potichu a je možné ho vypnout, aby nerušilo nebo nerozptylovalo uživatele Splnění tohoto požadavku pomáhá oddělit popředí od pozadí, takže jsou důležité informace lépe rozlišitelné. Toto má vliv jak na osoby, co nepoužívají asistenční technologie, tak na ty, kteří je používají. Ti mohou vnímat rušení, pokud je v pozadí výrazný audio nebo vizuální obsah. Například mnoho lidí s barvoslepostí nepoužívá určité nástroje a spoléhají se na vlastní design, který má dostatečný barevný kontrast mezi textem a jeho pozadím.

Webové standardy W3C se nazývají W3C Doporučení. Všechny standardy W3C jsou kontrolovány z hlediska podpory přístupnosti pracovní skupinou Accessible Platform Architectures ([APA (anglicky)]({{ \"/about/groups/apawg/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}). Následující standardy W3C a poznámky pracovní skupiny jsou pro přístupnost zvláště důležité. ## Pokyny pro přístupnost {#guidelines} [Základní komponenty webové přístupnosti (anglicky)]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} ukazují, jak webová přístupnost závisí na spolupráci několika složek vývoje a interakcí webu, a jak se jich týkají WAI pokyny (WCAG, ATAG, UAAG). ### Pokyny pro zpřístupnění obsahu webu (WCAG) 2 {#wcag2} Webový „obsah“ obvykle označuje informace na webové stránce nebo v aplikaci včetně: * přirozených informací jako text, obrázky a zvuk * kódu nebo markupu (značek), které tvoří strukturu, prezentaci, atd. WCAG se vztahuje na dynamický obsah, multimédia, „mobilní aplikace“ atd.

Jsem Strategický a Technologický Specialista pro Webovou Přístupnost ve W3C, Konsorciu pro World Wide Web a dnes bych s Vámi chtěl mluvit o přístupnosti webu. Webová přístupnost [Shadi mluví] Web je pro mnoho lidí nezbytná součást denního života. Lidé v internetové kavárně V práci. Člověk v kanceláří používá počítač Doma. Člověk na pohovce používá notebook I na cestách. Člověk používá mobilní telefon při chůzi Přístupnost webu znamená, že lidé s postiženími mohou používat web rovnocenně. [Shadi mluví] Například někdo, kdo nemůže používat ruce a používá ústní kompenzační pomůcky pro psaní. Člověk používá ústní kompenzační pomůcku pro psaní Nebo někdo, kdo neslyší dobře a používá titulky při sledování videí. Člověk používá naslouchátko Nebo někdo, kdo nevidí dobře a používá čtečku obrazovky, která nahlas přečte, co je na obrazovce. Člověk používá čtečku obrazovky Webová přístupnost má mnoho výhod. [Shadi mluví] Například titulky pomáhájí komukoliv v hlučném nebo tichém prostředí. Člověk sleduje video s titulkami v kanceláři A dobrý barevný kontrast pomáhá při oslnění. Člověk se dívá na mobilní telefon s oslněnou obrazovkou Přístupnost je dobrá také pro lidi staršího věku, jejichž zručnost může být zhoršena. Člověk s třesoucíma se rukama má problémy použít myš Zlepšení dispozice a designu je lepší pro uživatelský prožitek. Dva lidé se usmívají nad dobře navrženou webovou stránkou Velká část přístupnosti může být naprogramovaná přímo v kódu webové stránky a aplikace. [Shadi mluví] Webové technologie z W3C, jako třeba HTML, podporují mnoho přístupných funkcí. HTML kód pro webovou stránku Například funkce pro poskytování alternativních popisků pro obrázky, které jsou nahlas přečtené odečítačem obrazovky a také je využívají vyhledávače. Příklad kódu Stejně tak nadpisy, popisky formulářů a další funkce podporují přístupnost a celkově vylepšují kvalitu. Příklad programu Dobré vývojové nástroje jako wiki, systémy pro správu obsahu a editory kódu pomáhají tvořit přístupný kód. Buď automaticky nebo s přispěním autora. Příklad vývojových nástrojů pro vytváření webového obsahu Přístupné funkce potřebují podporovat také prohlížeče, přehrávače a aplikace. Příklad webového prohlížeče používaného pro zobrazení webového obsahu W3C poskytuje standardy, které pomáhají vytvářet přístupný web. Tyto standardy jsou mezinárodně uznávané vládami a podniky. [Shadi mluví] Nejznámější jsou Pokyny pro zpřístupnění obsahu webu - WCAG. WCAG jsou také norma ISO 40500, a jsou zahrnuté v evropské normě EN 301 549. Pokyny mají čtyři hlavní principy: Pokyny pro zpřístupnění o – WCAG, ISO 40500, EN 301 549 Zaprvé Vnímatelnost - například aby lidé mohli vidět nebo slyšet obsah. Člověk píše na tabletu a poslouchá sluchátky Operativnost - například aby lidé mohli ovládat počítač jak klávesnicí, tak hlasem. Člověk mluví na svůj počítač Srozumitelnost - například aby lidé porozuměli jasnému a jednoduchému vyjadřování. Dva lidé vypadají zmateně u obrazovky počítače s hustě popsanou stránkou A Robustnost - aby lidé mohli používat různé kompenzační pomůcky. Člověk používá lupu obrazovky na velké obrazovce Mimo WCAG, W3C také poskytuje Pokyny pro zpřístupnění vývojových nástrojů - ATAG, které definují požadavky pro systémy spravování obsahu, editory kódu a další software. Pokyny pro zpřístupnění vývojových nástrojů - ATAG A Pokyny k uživatelským agentům - UAAG definují požadavky pro webové prohlížeče a přehrávače. A Pokyny k uživatelským agentům - UAAG Na světě je přes miliardu lidí s postižením, to je 15-20% populace. Konvence Organizace spojených národů pro práva lidí s postižením stanovuje, že přístup k informacím, včetně webu, je lidské právo. Většina států tuto konvenci schválila, a některé přijaly zavazující opatření. I přes zákony a regulace, používání standardů pro webovou přístupnost je nezbytné pro lidi s postižením a užitečné pro všechny.

Mein Name ist Shadi Abou-Zahra. Ich arbeite als Accessibility Strategy- und Technology-Spezialist im W3C-Büro, dem World Wide Web Consortium, und heute möchte ich Ihnen mehr über Web-Accessibility erzählen. Web-Accessibility [Shadi spricht] Das Web ist für viele Menschen ein essentieller Teil des Lebens geworden. Menschen in einem Internetcafé Bei der Arbeit. Jemand nutzt einen Computer im Büro. Zuhause. Jemand nutzt einen Laptop auf dem Sofa. Und unterwegs. Jemand nutzt ein Mobiltelefon im Laufen. Web-Accessibility bedeutet, dass Menschen mit Beeinträchtigung das Web gleichermaßen nutzen können. [Shadi spricht] Beispielsweise kann jemand, anstelle der Hände, einen Mundstab zum Schreiben benutzen. Jemand schreibt mit einem Mundstab. Ebenso kann jemand mit Hörbeeinträchtigungen Untertitel beim Betrachten von Videos einblenden. Person mit Hörgerät Oder jemand, der nicht gut sieht, kann ein Bildschirmlese-Programm zum Vorlesen verwenden. Jemand nutzt ein Bildschirmlese-Programm Accessibility hat viele Vorteile. [Shadi spricht] Zum Beispiel können Untertitel jedem nutzen, ob in lauter oder leiser Umgebung. Jemand schaut im Büro ein Video mit Untertiteln. Und ein guter Farbkontrast hilft bei blendendem Licht. Jemand schaut auf ein Mobiltelefon mit Lichtreflexen auf dem Bildschirm Auch Menschen mit altersbedingten Einschränkungen, wie reduzierter Geschicklichkeit, profitieren. Person mit Tremor hat Schwierigkeiten, eine Maus zu bedienen. Tatsächlich erfährt jeder dank verbessertem Layout und Design eine bessere Benutzererfahrung. Zwei Personen, die glücklich über eine gut gestaltete Website lächeln. Viel Accessibility kann direkt in den Code von Webseiten und Applikationen eingebaut werden. [Shadi spricht] W3C-Webtechnologien, wie HTML, bieten Support für viele Accessibility-Features. HTML-Code einer Webseite Zum Beispiel Features, die Textalternativen für Bilder zur Verfügung stellen, welche von Bildschirmlese-Programmen laut vorgelesen und von Suchmaschinen benutzt werden. Codebeispiel Auch Überschriften, Labels und anderer Code unterstützen Accessibility und verbessern die Qualität allgemein. Codebeispiel Gute Authoring-Tools, wie Wikis, Content-Management-Systeme und Code-Editoren, helfen beim Erstellen von zugänglichem Code, entweder automatisch oder mittels Autoren-Inputs. Beispiel eines Authoring-Tools zum Erstellen von Web-Inhalten Auch Web-Browser, Media-Player und Apps müssen Accessibility-Features unterstützen. Beispiel eines Web-Browsers zum Anzeigen von Web-Inhalten Das W3C definiert Standards, die helfen das Web zugänglicher zu machen, und dabei international von Regierungen und der Business-Welt anerkannt werden. [Shadi spricht] Am bekanntesten sind die Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Die WCAG entsprechen dem ISO-Standard 40500 und wurden in den europäischen Standard EN 301 549 aufgenommen. Sie sind nach vier Grundprinzipien aufgebaut: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG); ISO 40500; EN 301 549 Erstens „wahrnehmbar“ – so dass man den Inhalt beispielsweise sehen oder hören kann. Jemand schreibt auf einem Tablet-Computer und hört dabei das Geschriebene mit Kopfhörern an. „Bedienbar“ – so dass man den Computer beispielsweise mittels Tastatur oder Stimme benutzen kann. Jemand spricht mit seinem Computer „Verständlich“ – so dass man beispielsweise klare und einfache Sprache erhält. Zwei Personen schauen verwirrt auf einen Bildschirm mit einer unübersichtlichen Website Und „robust“ – so dass man verschiedene Technologien zur Unterstützung nutzen kann. Jemand nutzt eine Bildschirmlupe auf einem großen Bildschirm. Neben den WCAG stellt das W3C auch die Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) bereit, welche die Anforderungen an Content-Management-Systeme, Code-Editoren und Software definieren. Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) Und die User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) definieren die Anforderungen an Web-Browser und Media-Player. User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) Es gibt über eine Milliarde beeinträchtigte Menschen, was 15–20% der Bevölkerung entspricht. Die UN-Konvention für die Rechte der Menschen mit Beeinträchtigung definiert den Zugang zu Information, einschließlich dem Web, als Menschenrecht. Fast alle Länder dieser Welt haben diese UN-Konvention ratifiziert und einige haben darüber hinaus verbindliche Richtlinien verabschiedet. Doch unabhängig von Gesetzen und Regulierungen ist die Implementierung von Accessibility-Standards essentiell für Menschen mit Beeinträchtigung und nützlich für alle.

Ονομάζομαι Shadi Abou-Zahra. Eίμαι ο Ειδικός Στρατηγικής Προσβασιμότητας και Σχετικών Τεχνολογιών στο W3C, τη διεθνή κοινοπραξία World Wide Web Consortium, και σήμερα, θα ήθελα να σας μιλήσω για την προσβασιμότητα του Παγκόσμιου Ιστού. Προσβασιμότητα Παγκόσμιου Ιστού [Ο Shadi μιλάει] Ο Παγκόσμιος Ιστός αποτελεί για πολλούς ένα ουσιαστικό μέρος της καθημερινής ζωής. Άνθρωποι σε ένα Internet cafe Στην εργασία. Κάποιος σε ένα γραφείο που χρησιμοποιεί υπολογιστή Στο σπίτι. Κάποιος που κάθεται σε έναν καναπέ χρησιμοποιώντας ένα φορητό υπολογιστή Και στον δρόμο. Κάποιος που χρησιμοποιεί ένα κινητό τηλέφωνο ενώ περπατά Η προσβασιμότητα στον Παγκόσμιο Ιστό σημαίνει ότι τα άτομα με αναπηρίες μπορούν να χρησιμοποιούν τον Παγκόσμιο Ιστό ισότιμα. [Ο Shadi μιλάει] Για παράδειγμα, κάποιος που δεν μπορεί να χρησιμοποιήσει τα χέρια του, και χρησιμοποιεί ένα mouthstick, για να πληκτρολογήσει. Κάποιος που χρησιμοποιεί ένα mouthstick για να πληκτρολογήσει Ή κάποιος που δεν μπορεί να ακούσει καλά και χρησιμοποιεί υπότιτλους για να παρακολουθήσει βίντεο. Κάποιος που χρησιμοποιεί ακουστικό Ή κάποιος που δεν μπορεί να δει καλά και χρησιμοποιεί ένα πρόγραμμα ανάγνωσης οθόνης για να διαβάσει δυνατά τι βρίσκεται στην οθόνη. Κάποιος που χρησιμοποιεί ένα πρόγραμμα ανάγνωσης οθόνης Η προσβασιμότητα έχει πολλά οφέλη. [Ο Shadi μιλάει] Για παράδειγμα, οι υπότιτλοι ωφελούν τους πάντες σε ένα δυνατό ή ήσυχο περιβάλλον. Κάποιος βλέπει ένα βίντεο με υπότιτλους σε ένα γραφείο Και η καλή αντίθεση χρώματος λειτουργεί καλύτερα όταν υπάρχει αντανάκλαση. Κάποιος κοιτάζει ένα κινητό τηλέφωνο με αντανάκλαση στην οθόνη Επίσης, ωφελούνται τα άτομα με μειονεκτήματα που σχετίζονται με την ηλικία, όπως η μειωμένη επιδεξιότητα. Κάποιος με τρέμουλο που χρησιμοποιεί ένα ποντίκι με δυσκολία Στην πραγματικότητα, ο καθένας έχει καλύτερη εμπειρία χρήστη με βελτιωμένη διάταξη (layout) και σχεδιασμό. Δύο άνθρωποι χαμογελούν βλέποντας μια καλά σχεδιασμένη ιστοσελίδα Πολλή προσβασιμότητα μπορεί να ενσωματωθεί στον υποκείμενο κώδικα ιστοσελίδων και εφαρμογών. [Ο Shadi μιλάει] Οι τεχνολογίες του Παγκόσμιου Ιστού από το W3C, όπως η HTML, παρέχουν υποστήριξη για πολλές δυνατότητες προσβασιμότητας. Ο HTML κώδικας μιας ιστοσελίδας Για παράδειγμα, λειτουργίες για την παροχή εναλλακτικού κειμένου για εικόνες, που διαβάζονται δυνατά από τους αναγνώστες οθόνης και χρησιμοποιούνται, επίσης, από τις μηχανές αναζήτησης. Παράδειγμα κώδικα Επίσης, οι επικεφαλίδες, οι ετικέτες πεδίων φόρμας και άλλος κώδικας υποστηρίζουν την προσβασιμότητα και βελτιώνουν την ποιότητα συνολικά. Παράδειγμα κώδικα Καλά εργαλεία συγγραφής κώδικα, όπως wikis, συστήματα διαχείρισης περιεχομένου και συντάκτες κώδικα, βοηθούν στη δημιουργία προσβάσιμου κώδικα είτε αυτόματα είτε με τη συμβολή του δημιουργού. Παράδειγμα εργαλείου συγγραφής που χρησιμοποιείται για τη δημιουργία περιεχομένου ιστού Επίσης, τα προγράμματα περιήγησης Παγκόσμιου Ιστού, οι συσκευές αναπαραγωγής πολυμέσων και οι εφαρμογές πρέπει να υποστηρίζουν τις δυνατότητες προσβασιμότητας. Παράδειγμα περιηγητή ιστού που χρησιμοποιείται για την προβολή περιεχομένου ιστού Το W3C παρέχει πρότυπα-οδηγίες, για να βοηθήσουν τον Παγκόσμιο Ιστό να είναι προσβάσιμος, που αναγνωρίζονται διεθνώς από τις κυβερνήσεις και τις επιχειρήσεις. [Ο Shadi μιλάει] Οι πιο γνωστές είναι οι Οδηγίες για την Προσβασιμότητα του Περιεχομένου του Παγκόσμιου Ιστού (WCAG). Το WCAG είναι επίσης το πρότυπο ISO 40500, και έχει υιοθετηθεί στο Ευρωπαϊκό Πρότυπο EN 301 549. Είναι χτισμένο γύρω από τέσσερις βασικές αρχές: Οδηγίες για την Προσβασιμότητα του Περιεχομένου του Παγκόσμιου Ιστού - WCAG, ISO 40500 , EN 301 549 Πρώτα: Αντιληπτό περιεχόμενο - για παράδειγμα, έτσι ώστε οι χρήστες να μπορούν να δουν το περιεχόμενο ή να το ακούσουν. Κάποιος πληκτρολογώντας στον υπολογιστή ταμπλέτας και ακούγοντάς τον με ακουστικά Λειτουργικό περιεχόμενο - για παράδειγμα, έτσι ώστε οι χρήστες να μπορούν να χρησιμοποιούν τον υπολογιστή πληκτρολογώντας ή φωνητικά. Κάποιος μιλάει στον υπολογιστή του Κατανοητό περιεχόμενο - για παράδειγμα, έτσι ώστε οι άνθρωποι να λαμβάνουν σαφή και απλή γλώσσα. Δύο άνθρωποι που μπερδεύονται στην οθόνη του υπολογιστή με μια πυκνή ιστοσελίδα Και Εύρωστο περιεχόμενο - έτσι ώστε οι άνθρωποι να μπορούν να χρησιμοποιούν διαφορετικές υποστηρικτικές τεχνολογίες. Κάποιος που χρησιμοποιεί μεγέθυνση οθόνης σε μεγάλη οθόνη υπολογιστή Εκτός από το WCAG, το W3C παρέχει επίσης τις Οδηγίες Προσβασιμότητας για Εργαλεία Συγγραφής (ATAG), που ορίζουν τις απαιτήσεις για συστήματα διαχείρισης περιεχομένου, συντάκτες κώδικα και άλλο λογισμικό. Οδηγίες Προσβασιμότητας για Εργαλεία Συγγραφής - ATAG Και τις Οδηγίες Προσβασιμότητας για Πράκτορες Χρήστη (UAAG), που καθορίζουν τις απαιτήσεις για προγράμματα περιήγησης Παγκόσμιου Ιστού και αναπαραγωγής πολυμέσων. Οδηγίες Προσβασιμότητας για Πράκτορες Χρήστη - UAAG Υπάρχουν πάνω από ένα δισεκατομμύριο άτομα με αναπηρίες, ή περίπου το 15 - 20% του πληθυσμού. Η Σύμβαση των Ηνωμένων Εθνών για τα Δικαιώματα των Ατόμων με Αναπηρία ορίζει την πρόσβαση σε πληροφορίες, συμπεριλαμβανομένου του Παγκόσμιου Ιστού, ως ανθρώπινο δικαίωμα. Οι περισσότερες χώρες του κόσμου έχουν επικυρώσει αυτή τη σύμβαση των Ηνωμένων Εθνών, και αρκετές έχουν υιοθετήσει και δεσμευτικές πολιτικές. Ωστόσο, ανεξάρτητα από τους νόμους και τους κανονισμούς, η εφαρμογή των προτύπων-οδηγιών προσβασιμότητας είναι απαραίτητη για τα άτομα με αναπηρία, και χρήσιμη για όλους.

Sin embargo, en la actualidad muchos sitios y herramientas están desarrollados incluyendo barreras de accesibilidad que dificultan o imposibilitan su uso por parte de algunas personas.

Los estándares web internacionales definen lo que la accesibilidad necesita. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::options toc_levels=\"2\" /} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"start\" title=\"Contenido de la Página\" class=\"full\" %} {:/} - TOC is created automatically. {:toc} Recursos relacionados {% include video-link.html title=\"Video Introducción a la Accesibilidad Web y Estándares W3C (4 minutos)\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/videos/standards-and-benefits.html\" src=\"/content-images/wai-intro-accessibility/video-still-accessibility-intro-16-9.jpg\" %} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Accesibilidad en contexto {#context} El poder de la Web está en su universalidad. El acceso para cualquier persona, independientemente de las discapacidades, es un aspecto esencial. Tim Berners-Lee, Director del W3C Director e inventor de la World Wide Web La Web está fundamentalmente diseñada para que todo el mundo pueda usarla, independientemente del hardware, software, idioma, ubicación o capacidad. Cuando la Web cumple ese objetivo, es accesible para personas con un diverso rango de audición, movimiento, visión y habilidades cognitivas. Por lo tanto, el impacto de la discapacidad cambia radicalmente en la Web porque ésta elimina las barreras de comunicación e interacción que muchas personas encuentran en el mundo físico. Sin embargo, cuando los sitios web, aplicaciones, tecnologías o herramientas están mal diseñados, pueden crear barreras que excluyen a las personas del uso de la Web. **La Accesibilidad es esencial para desarrolladores y organizaciones que quieren crear sitios y herramientas web de calidad y no excluir personas del uso de sus productos y servicios.** ## Qué es la Accesibilidad Web {#what} Accesibilidad Web significa que sitios web, herramientas y tecnologías están diseñadas y desarrolladas de tal manera que las personas con discapacidades pueden usarlas. Más concretamente, las personas pueden: - percibir, comprender, navegar e interactuar con la Web - contribuir a la Web La Accesibilidad web abarca todas las discapacidades que afectan al acceso a la Web, incluyendo: - auditivas - cognitivas - neurológicas - físicas - del habla - visuales La accesibilidad web también beneficia personas *sin* discapacidad, como por ejemplo: - personas utilizando teléfonos móviles, relojes inteligentes, televisores inteligentes y otros dispositivos con pantallas pequeñas, diferentes modos de entrada, etc. - personas mayores cuyas habilidades cambian con la edad - personas con \"discapacidades temporales\", como puede ser un brazo roto o la pérdida de unas gafas - personas con \"limitaciones por su ubicación\", como puede ser bajo la luz del sol o en un entorno donde no se puede escuchar audio - personas con conexión lenta a Internet o que tienen ancho de banda limitado o costoso Puede ver un vídeo de 7 minutos con ejemplos de cómo la accesibilidad es esencial para personas con discapacidades y útil para cualquier persona en una gran variedad de situaciones: {% include video-link.html title=\"Perspectivas de Accesibilidad Web (YouTube)\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f31oufqFSM\" src=\"/content-images/wai-intro-accessibility/video-still-accessibility-perspectives-16-9.jpg\" %} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"3\" title=\"Más información sobre Qué es Accesibilidad\" class=\"simple aside\" %} {:/} - Si desea aprender más acerca de cómo las diferentes discapacidades afectan en el uso de la Web y leer sobre escenarios de personas con discapacidad usando la Web, acceda a [Cómo usan la web las personas con discapacidad]({{ \"/people-use-web/es\" | relative_url }}). - Si desea más ejemplos de beneficios para otras personas, con las WCAG como ayuda, acceda a [Experiencias Web Compartidas: Barreras comunes para Personas Usuarias de Dispositivos Móviles y Personas con Discapacidades (en Inglés)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/shared-experiences/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} y a [Accesibilidad Web Beneficia a Personas con y sin Discapacidades](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/archive/soc#groups). {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## La Accesibilidad es importante para las personas, empresas y sociedad {#important} La Web es un recurso importante en muchos aspectos de la vida: educación, trabajo, gobierno, salud, entretenimiento y más. Es esencial que la Web sea accesible de cara a facilitar igualdad de acceso y oportunidades a las personas con diferentes habilidades. El acceso a las tecnologías de la información y comunicación, incluyendo la Web, está definido como un derecho humano básico en la Convención de las Naciones Unidas sobre los Derechos de las Personas con Discapacidades (UN [CRPD](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html)). La Web ofrece la posibilidad sin precedentes de acceso a la información e interacción para muchas personas con discapacidad. Esto significa que las barreras de accesibilidad a material impreso, audio y medios visuales pueden ser más fácilmente superables a través de las tecnologías web. La Accesibilidad da soporte a la inclusión social tanto a personas con discapacidad como a otras tales como: - personas mayores - personas en áreas rurales - personas en países en desarrollo **También existe un sólido argumento comercial a favor de la accesibilidad.** Como se mostró en la sección previa, el diseño accesible mejora la experiencia y satisfacción de las personas usuarias, en una variedad de situaciones, a través de diferentes dispositivos y para personas mayores. Además, la accesibilidad puede mejorar su marca, impulsar la innovación y ampliar su alcance en el mercado.

También está disponible para tecnologías que no pueden ver imágenes, como por ejemplo los motores de búsqueda. ### Entrada con teclado ![Ratón tachado con una cruz](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/no-mouse.png){:.left width=\"67\" height=\"45\"} Algunas personas no pueden utilizar ratón, incluyendo muchas personas mayores con control de la motricidad limitado. Un sitio web accesible no depende del ratón; hace que [toda la funcionalidad esté disponible para el teclado](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation.html). Entonces, las personas con discoapacidad pueden utilizar [tecnologías de apoyo (en Inglés)]({{ \"/planning/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}#at){: hreflang=\"en\"} que simulan el teclado, como por ejemplo la entrada por voz. ### Transcripciones para audio [![ejemplo transcrito](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/transcript.png){:.right width=\"251\" height=\"254\"}](http://www.w3.org/WAI/highlights/200606wcag2interview.html) Del mismo modo que las imágenes no están disponibles para las personas que no pueden ver, los archivos de audio no están disponibles para las personas que no pueden oír. Proporcionar una transcripción de texto hace que la información de audio sea accesible para las personas sordas o con problemas de audición, así como para los motores de búsqueda y otras tecnologías que no pueden oír. Facilitar transcripciones es fácil y relativamente barato para los sitios web. También existen [servicios de transcripción](http://www.uiaccess.com/transcripts/transcript_services.html) que crean transcripciones textuales en formato HTML. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"3\" title=\"More Examples\" class=\"simple aside\" %} {:/} - [Consejos para empezar (en Inglés)]({{ \"/tips/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} - [Pruebas sencillas - Una Primera Revisión (en Inglés)]({{ \"/test-evaluate/preliminary/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} - {% include video-link.html class=\"small inline\" title=\"Perspectivas de Accesibilidad Web &mdash; videos y descripciones\" href=\"/perspective-videos/\" src=\"/content-images/wai-intro-accessibility/video-still-accessibility-perspectives-16-9.jpg\" %} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} ## Para más información {#more-info} W3C WAI facilita un ámplio rango de recursos sobre diferentes aspectos de los [estándares]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/es\" | relative_url }}) de accesibilidad web la accesibilidad web, [formación]({{ \"/teach-advocate/es\" | relative_url }}), [testing/evaluación]({{ \"/test-evaluate/es\" | relative_url }}), [gestión de proyectos y políticas]({{ \"/planning/es\" | relative_url }}).

Los documentos WCAG explican cómo hacer el contenido web más accesible para las personas con discapacidad. Por “contenido” web se hace referencia, generalmente, a la información que se puede encontrar en una página o aplicación web, lo cual incluye: - información natural como textos, imágenes y sonidos. - código o marcado que define la estructura, la presentación, etc. ## WCAG 2.0 y 2.1 {#versions} WCAG 2.0 se publicó el 11 de diciembre del 2008. WCAG 2.1 se publicó el 5 de junio del 2018. Todos los requisitos (criterios de conformidad) de la versión 2.0 están incluidos en 2.1. Los criterios de conformidad 2.0 son exactamente iguales (literalmente) en 2.1. Hay criterios de conformidad adicionales en 2.1 que no existen en 2.0. Se hace una presentación de ellos en las [Novedades en WCAG 2.1]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/es\" | relative_url }}). **El contenido que es conforme con WCAG 2.1 también lo es con WCAG 2.0** (se suele decir que se da “retrocompatibilidad”). Un sitio web que cumpla con WCAG 2.1 cumpliría con los requisitos de las políticas que hacen referencia a WCAG 2.0. Dicho de otra forma: si se desea cumplir tanto con WCAG 2.0 y 2.1, se pueden usar los recursos de 2.1 y no sería necesario consultar los relativos a 2.0. Tanto WCAG 2.0 como 2.1 son estándares actuales. WCAG 2.1 no deja WCAG 2.0 obsoleto ni lo sustituye. Desde W3C se anima a usar la versión más reciente de WCAG al desarrollar o actualizar contenido o políticas de accesibilidad. ## Destinatarios de WCAG {#for} WCAG se dirige principalmente a: - Desarrolladores de contenido web (autores de páginas, diseñadores de sitios, etc.) - Desarrolladores de programas de autor - Desarrolladores de herramientas para la evaluación de la accesibilidad web - Otros que quieran o necesiten un estándar para la accesibilidad web, incluyendo la accesibilidad móvil Los recursos relacionados se dirigen a cubrir las necesidades de diferentes personas, entre ellas legisladores, directores, investigadores y otros. WCAG es un estándar técnico, no una introducción a la accesibilidad. Si busca material introductorio, consulte [“¿Dónde debería empezar?” en las FAQ (en Inglés)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/faq/\" | relative_url }}#start){: hreflang=\"en\"}. ## Contenido de los documentos de las WCAG 2 {#whatis2} **[WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)** y **[WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)** son estándares técnicos estables y de referencia. Contienen 12-13 pautas que se agrupan en [cuatro principios: perceptible, operable, comprensible y robusto](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility). Cada pauta incluye *criterios de conformidad*, que se pueden comprobar y que se clasifican en [tres niveles: A, AA y AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#levels). Puede leer un resumen breve sobre las WCAG 2 consultando **[WCAG 2.1 de un vistazo]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/es\" | relative_url }})**. Si desea aprender sobre principios y directrices de accesibilidad web, consulte los **[Principios de accesibilidad]({{ \"/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/es\" | relative_url }})**. Los materiales de apoyo de las WCAG 2 comprenden: - [**Cómo cumplir con las WCAG 2**: Una guía de referencia rápida y personalizable que incluye los requisitos (criterios de conformidad) y técnicas de las Pautas de Accesibilidad para el Contenido Web](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) que es, en esencia, [la lista de control de WCAG 2](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/). La mayoría de la gente utiliza esta guía de referencia rápida como herramienta principal para trabajar con las WCAG. - **Técnicas para las WCAG 2** ([Técnicas 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/), [Técnicas 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/)) proporcionan información específica para desarrollar contenido accesible, como por ejemplo fragmentos de código HTML. Las técnicas son “informativas”, lo cual quiere decir que no tiene por qué usarlas. La base para determinar la conformidad con WCAG 2 reside en los *criterios de conformidad* del texto WCAG 2 estándar y no en las técnicas. Lea más sobre las [Técnicas en las FAQ (en Inglés)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/faq/\" | relative_url }}#techs){: hreflang=\"en\"}. - **Comprender las WCAG 2** ([Comprender 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/), [Comprender 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/)) contiene asistencia adicional para aprender a implementar las WCAG 2 dirigida a aquellas personas que quieran comprender las pautas y criterios de conformidad en profundidad. Puede obtener más información sobre cómo estos documentos se relacionan entre sí consultando los **[\"Documentos WCAG 2\" (en Inglés)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/docs/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}**. ### Traducciones Las traducciones de WCAG 2 autorizadas y las no oficiales se enumeran en [\"Traducciones de WCAG 2\" (en Inglés)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/translations/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}. ### Formato de documento técnico Los documentos de las WCAG, Técnicas y Comprender siguen el formato para informes técnicos del W3C, que contiene varias secciones al principio, incluyendo enlaces a versiones diferentes, editores, resumen y estado. ### Orientación suplementaria {#supplement} La orientación suplementaria proporciona información adicional que va más allá de lo requerido en las WCAG 2.0 y 2.1. Trata de mejorar la accesibilidad para las personas con discapacidad cognitiva y visión baja. En el futuro, enlaces a información suplementaria serán añadidos en esta sección. ## WCAG 2.0 es ISO/IEC 40500 {#iso} Las WCAG 2.0 están aprobadas como un estándar ISO: ISO/IEC 40500:2012. Éste es exactamente igual que las WCAG 2.0 originales, que se presentan arriba junto con los recursos de apoyo. El contenido de ISO/IEC 40500 está disponible gratuitamente en [www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/); también está disponible para ser comprado en el [catálogo ISO {% include_cached external.html %}](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=58625). Los beneficios de tener las WCAG como un estándar ISO se resumen en las [FAQ sobre ISO (en Inglés)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/faq/\" | relative_url }}#iso){: hreflang=\"en\"}. Se puede encontrar más información sobre W3C y el proceso ISO en las [FAQ de W3C PAS](http://www.w3.org/2010/04/pasfaq). ## Otras pautas {#components} Las WCAG forman parte de una serie de pautas de accesibilidad, que incluye a las Pautas de Accesibilidad para las Herramientas de Creación de Contenido (ATAG) y las Pautas de Accesibilidad para el Agente de Usuario (UAAG). Los [\"componentes esenciales de la accesibilidad web\" (en Inglés)]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} explican la relación entre estas pautas diferentes. ## Quién desarrolla las WCAG {#wg} Los documentos técnicos de las WCAG son desarrollados por el Grupo de Trabajo de las Pautas de Accesibilidad ([AG WG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/)) *(anteriormente conocido como el Grupo de Trabajo de las Pautas de Accesibilidad para el Contenido Web)*, el cual forma parte de la Iniciativa por la Accesibilidad Web ([WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)) del World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org)).

Entre ellos se incluyen: - **Contenido Web**{:#webcontent} – hace referencia a cualquier parte de un sitio web, incluyendo texto, imágenes, formularios y multimedia, así como a cualquier código de marcado, scripts, aplicaciones y demás. - **Agentes de usuario**{:#useragents} – software que las personas utilizan para acceder al contenido web, incluyendo navegadores gráficos de escritorio, navegadores de voz, navegadores de teléfono móvil, reproductores multimedia, plug-ins y algunas [tecnologías de apoyo (en Inglés)]({{ \"/people-use-web/tools-techniques/\" | relative_url }}#at \"definition\"){: hreflang=\"en\"}. - **Herramientas de autor**{:#authoringtools} – software o servicios que las personas utilizan para producir contenido web, incluyendo editores de código, herramientas de conversión de documentos, sistemas de gestión de contenido, blogs, scripts de base de datos y otras herramientas. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Más acerca de estándares de accesibilidad web {:.no_toc} {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Estos componentes se interrelacionan y dan soporte mutuamente. Por ejemplo, el **contenido web** necesita incluir alternativas textuales para las imágenes. Esta información necesita ser procesada por los **navegadores web** y luego ser transmitida a las **tecnologías de apoyo**, como los lectores de pantalla. Para crear dichas alternativas textuales, los autores necesitan **herramientas de autor** con soporte para dicha función. Más información sobre el tema en [Componentes Esenciales de la Accesibilidad Web (en Inglés)]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}. Los estándares juegan un papel vital en la definición de los requisitos de accesibilidad de estos componentes. Algunos requisitos de accesibilidad son fáciles de cumplir y, simplemente entendiendo los conceptos básicos de cómo las personas con discapacidad utilizan la Web, ayuda a implementarlos de forma más eficaz y eficiente. Algunos aspectos de la accesibilidad requieren más habilidades técnicas o conocimientos avanzados sobre el uso que hacen las personas de la Web. En todos los casos, [involucrar a los usuarios desde el principio y a lo largo de sus proyectos web (en Inglés)]({{ \"/test-evaluate/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} hará su trabajo mejor y más fácil. La Iniciativa de Accesibilidad Web del W3C (WAI) facilita un conjunto de pautas que son reconocidas internationalmente como estándares para la accesibilidad web. Estas incluyen: - **[Pautas de Accesibilidad al Contenido Web (WCAG)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/es\" | relative_url }})** - **[Pautas de Accesibilidad de Agente de Usuario (UAAG) (en Inglés)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/uaag/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}** - **[Pautas de Accesibilidad de Herramientas de Autor (ATAG) (en Inglés)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/atag/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}** También hay una especificación WAI para **[Aplicaciones de internet enriquecidas y accesibles (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php)**, que incluyen contenido dinámico y controles avanzados de usuario desarrollados con Ajax, JavasScript, y otras tecnologías web relacionadas. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} ## Información perceptible e interfaz de usuario {#perceivable} ### Alternativas de texto para contenido no textual {#alternatives} Las alternativas de texto son equivalentes para el contenido no textual. Entre los ejemplos se incluyen: - Equivalentes cortos para imágenes, incluyendo iconos, botones y gráficos - Descripción de los datos representados en gráficos, diagramas e ilustraciones - Breves descripciones de contenido no textual como archivos de audio y vídeo - Etiquetas para controles de formulario, entrada de datos y otros componentes de la interfaz de usuario Las alternativas textuales transmiten el propósito o función de una imagen para proporcionar una experiencia de usuario equivalente. Por ejemplo, una alternativa textual apropiada para un botón de búsqueda sería \"*buscar*\" en lugar de \"*lupa*\". Las alternativas textuales pueden ser presentadas de varias maneras. Por ejemplo, pueden ser leidas en voz alta para personas que no pueden ver la pantalla y para aquellas con dificultades de lectura, ampliadas a tamaño de texto personalizados, o mostrarse en dispositivos braille. Las alternativas textuales sirven como etiquetas para controles y funcionalidad que ayudan a la navegación con teclado o por reconocimiento de voz (entrada por voz). También actuan como etiquetas para identificar audios, videos y archivos en otros formatos, así como aplicaciones que están integradas como parte de un sitio web. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} #### Requisitos de accesibilidad relacionados con alternativas textuales (enlaces a la especificación técnica) {:.no_toc} {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} **WCAG** - [Pauta 1.1 – Alternativas Textuales](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#text-alternatives) **UAAG** - [Pauta 1.1 – Contenido Alternativo](https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/#gl-access-alternative-content) **ATAG** - [Principio A.1: Las interfaces de usuario de las herramientas de autor siguen las pautas de accesibilidad aplicables](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#principle_a1) - [Pauta A.2.1: (Para la interfaz de herramienta de autor) Hacer disponible el contenido alternativo para los autores](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a21) - [Pauta A.2.2: (Para la interfaz de herramienta de autor) Asegurar que la presentación de la vista de edición pueda ser determinada programáticamente](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a22) - [Pauta A.3.7: (Para la interfaz de herramienta de autor) Asegurar que las previsualizaciones son al menos tan accesibles como los agentes de usuario del mercado](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a37) - [Apartado B.

Por ejemplo, se puede presentar usando combinaciones de color personalizadas, tamaño de texto u otro estilo para facilitar la lectura. Este requisito también facilita otras formas de adaptación, incluyendo la generación automática de esquemas de página y resúmenes para ayudar a obtener una visión general y a centrarse en partes concretas con más facilidad. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} #### Requisitos de accesibilidad relacionados con adaptabilidad (enlaces a la especificación técnica) {:.no_toc} {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} **WCAG** - [Pauta 1.3 - Adaptable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#adaptable) **UAAG** - [Pauta 1.4 – Configuración de texto](https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/#gl-text-config) - [Pauta 1.5 – Configuración del volumen](https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/#gl-volume-config) - [Pauta 1.6 - Configuración de voz sintetizada](https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/#gl-speech-config) - [Pauta 1.7 – Configuración de hojas de estilo de usuario](https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/#gl-style-sheets-config) - [Pauta 1.9 – Vistas alternativas](https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/#gl-alternative-views) - [Pauta 1.10 – Información de elementos](https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/#gl-info-link) **ATAG** - [Principio A.1: Las interfaces de usuario de las herramientas de autor siguen las pautas de accesibilidad aplicables](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#principle_a1) - [Pauta A.2.2: (Para la interfaz de herramienta de autor) Asegurar que la presentación de la vista de edición pueda ser determinada programáticamente](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a22) - [Pauta A.3.7: (Para la interfaz de herramienta de autor) Asegurar que las previsualizaciones son al menos tan accessibles como los agentes de usuario del mercado](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a37) - [Apartado B.

Algunos ejemplos: - El color no se utiliza como única forma de transmitir información o identificar el contenido - Las combinaciones predeterminadas de color de primer plano y fondo proporcionan suficiente contraste - Cuando los usuarios redimensionan el texto hasta un 400% o cambian el espaciado del texto, no se pierde información - Reflujo de texto en ventanas pequeñas (\"viewports\") y cuando los usuarios hacen el texto más grande - Las imágenes de texto se redimensionan, se sustituyen por texto real o se evitan en la medida de lo posible - Los usuarios pueden pausar, detener o ajustar el volumen de audio que se reproduce en un sitio web - El audio de fondo es bajo o se puede apagar para evitar interferencias o distracciones Cumplir con este requisito ayuda a separar el primer plano del fondo para hacer que la información importante sea más distinguible. Esto incluye consideraciones tanto para las personas que no utilizan tecnologías de apoyo como para las que si las utilizan y que pueden percibir interferencias de contenido de audio o visual del segundo plano. Por ejemplo, muchas personas con daltonismo no utilizan ninguna herramienta en particular y confían en un diseño adecuado que proporcione suficiente contraste de color entre el texto y el fondo que lo rodea.

Sin embargo, no todas pueden utilizar cada una de estas modalidades o utilizarlas en la misma medida. Las consideraciones particulares del diseño pueden maximizar el beneficio de cada una de ellas. Por ejemplo: - Gestos que requieren destreza o movimientos finos que tienen alternativas que no requieren avanzada destreza - Componentes que están diseñados para evitar la activación accidental, por ejemplo facilitando la función de deshacer - Etiquetas que corresponden con nombres en el código, lo cual da soporte a la activación por voz - Funcionalidad que es activada con movimiento y que también puede activarse mediante componentes de la interfaz de usuario - Botones, enlaces y otros componentes activos que tienen el tamaño suficiente para facilitar la activación por tacto Cumplir este requisito hace que el contenido más fácil de usar por cualquier persona con un amplios rangos de habilidades y de dispositivos.

Para ello, algunos ejemplos de lo que se puede hacer son: - Identificar el idioma primario de la página web, como el árabe, holandés o coreano - Identifiar el idioma de fragmentos de texto, frases, u otras partes de la página web - Proporcionar definiciones para palabras no comunes, fráses, modismos y abreviaturas inusuales - Utilizar el lenguaje más claro y simple posible, o proporcionar versiones simplificadas El cumplimiento de este requisito ayuda al software, incluyendo las tecnologías de apoyo, a procesar correctamente el contenido del texto. Por ejemplo, este requisito ayuda al software a leer el contenido en voz alta, a generar resúmenes de páginas y a proporcionar definiciones para palabras inusuales como la jerga técnica. También ayuda a las personas que tienen dificultad para entender oraciones más complejas, frases o vocabulario. En particular, ayuda a las personas con diferentes tipos de discapacidad cognitiva. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} #### Requisitos de accesibilidad relacionados con la legibilidad (enlaces a la especificación técnica) {:.no_toc} {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} **WCAG** - [Pauta 3.1 - Legible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#readable) **ATAG** - [Principio A.1: Las interfaces de usuario de las herramientas de autor siguen las pautas de accesibilidad aplicables](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#principle_a1) - [Pauta A.4.2: (Para la interfaz de herramienta de autor) Documentar la interfaz de usuario, incluidas todas las características de accesibilidad](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_b42) - [Apartado B.

Algunos ejemplos para hacer el contenido más predecible serían: - Mecanismos de navegación que se repiten en multiples páginas y que aparecen siempre en el mismo lugar - Componentes de la interfaz de usuaro que se repiten en páginas web y que tienen las mismas etiquetas - Cambios significativos en la página web que no ocurren sin el consentimiento del usuario El cumplimiento de este requisito ayuda a las personas a aprender rápidamente la funcionalidad y los mecanismos de navegación que se ofrecen en un sitio web, y a manejarlos de acuerdo con sus necesidades y preferencias específicas. Por ejemplo, algunas personas asignan teclas de acceso directo personalizadas a funciones que utilizan con frecuencia para mejorar la navegación con el teclado. Otras memorizan los pasos para llegar a determinadas páginas o para completar procesos en un sitio web.

Los estándares de W3C se llaman Recomendaciones del W3C. El soporte para la accesibilidad de todos los estándares de W3C es revisado por el Grupo de Trabajo de Arquitecturas de Plataforma Accesible - [APA (en Inglés)]({{ \"/about/groups/apawg/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}. Los estándares W3C y las Notas de los Grupos de Trabajo que se mencionan abajo son particularmente relevantes para la accesibilidad. ## Pautas de accesibilidad {#guidelines} En los [componentes esenciales de la accesibilidad web (en Inglés)]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} se puede ver que la accesibilidad depende de varios componentes de desarrollo web que interactúan juntos y cómo se aplican las pautas de WAI (WCAG, ATAG, UAAG). ### Pautas de accesibilidad para el contenido web (WCAG) 2 {#wcag2} Por “contenido” web se hace referencia, generalmente, a la información que se puede encontrar en una página o aplicación web, lo cual incluye: * información natural como textos, imágenes y sonidos. * código o marcado que define la estructura, la presentación, etc. Las pautas WCAG se aplican al contenido dinámico, multimedia, “móvil”, etc. También se pueden aplicar a tecnologías de la información y la comunicación (TIC) no relacionadas con la web, como se explica en [WCAG2ICT (en Inglés)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/non-web-ict/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}.

Por ejemplo: editores de HTML, sistemas de gestión de contenidos (CMS) y sitios web que permiten a los usuarios añadir contenido tales como blogs y redes sociales. Los documentos ATAG explican cómo: * hacer que las herramientas de creación de contenido sean accesibles en sí mismas, de forma que las personas con discapacidad puedan crear contenido web, y * ayudar a los autores a crear contenido web más accesible.

    "text": "{::nomarkdown} {% include_cached box.html type=\"start\" h=\"2\" title=\"Resumen\" class=\"full\" %} {:/} Este artículo examina las razones que tienen las organizaciones para cumplir con la accesibilidad. Comprende beneficios tangibles e intangibles, así como los riesgos de no cumplir con la accesibilidad adecuadamente. Explora cómo la accesibilidad puede: - Impulsar la innovación: Las características accesibles de productos y servicios solucionan problemas imprevistos con frecuencia. - Mejorar la marca: Los esfuerzos en diversidad e inclusión que tan importantes son para el éxito de una empresa se ven impulsados cuando existe un compromiso claro y bien integrado con la accesibilidad. - Ampliar el alcance del mercado: El mercado global de personas con discapacidad incluye a más de un billón de personas que tienen un poder adquisitivo de más de 6 trillones de dólares. Además, la accesibilidad mejora la experiencia para todos los usuarios. - Minimizar el riesgo legal: Muchos países cuentan con leyes que exigen la accesibilidad web y se trata de una preocupación legal creciente. Advierta que los términos “accesibilidad web” y “sitios web” de este artículo también hacen referencia a las aplicaciones móviles y otras tecnologías digitales. {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached box.html type=\"end\" %} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"start\" title=\"Contenidos de la página\" class=\"simple\" %} {:/} {::options toc_levels=\"2,3\" /} - The TOC will replace this text. {:toc} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## ¿Existe un caso de negocios para la accesibilidad? Un caso de negocios es una herramienta necesaria para las organizaciones cuando tienen que planificar iniciativas. Ya sea una organización comercial, educativa, sin ánimo de lucro o gubernamental, lo cierto es que todas necesitan justificar los recursos, como dinero o esfuerzo, que se destinan a una política o meta empresarial específica. En este artículo, la palabra “negocio” hace referencia a todo tipo de organizaciones, comprendiendo que los aspectos relevantes serán diferentes dependiendo del objetivo y propósito de la organización. Por ejemplo, las agencias gubernamentales estarán principalmente motivadas por los aspectos legales y de equidad. Los negocios comerciales estarán más persuadidos por las oportunidades de innovación y de expansión del mercado. Los proyectos educativos y sin ánimo de lucro podrían estar atraídos por la mejora en la imagen de marca. Para crear un caso de negocios convincente, es importante resaltar los beneficios de la accesibilidad más relevantes en su entorno operativo específico. Existen beneficios tangibles e intangibles para aquellos negocios que dedican recursos a la accesibilidad digital. Un argumento frecuente en contra del caso de negocios de la accesibilidad es que el retorno de la inversión (ROI) directo es muy difícil de conmensurar. El retorno de la inversión es importante, por supuesto, pero de ninguna manera es el único método para medir cómo el compromiso con la accesibilidad beneficia a organizaciones de todo tipo. Un buen caso de negocios también presenta los costes y riesgos de la inacción. Lo más probable es que su negocio responda a una mezcla de factores motivantes al considerar la implementación de un programa de integración de la accesibilidad. Este artículo ofrece investigación y ejemplos para inspirar confianza entre líderes y responsables de tomar decisiones de que la inversión continua en accesibilidad es buena para su negocio. **Los negocios que integran la accesibilidad tienen más probabilidades de ser empresas innovadoras e inclusivas que llegan a más gente con una imagen de marca positiva y que cumplen con los requisitos legales emergentes.** Una investigación entre empresas del Fortune 100 indica que la inclusión de la discapacidad, como parte de una estrategia de diversidad general, es una práctica común entre las empresas con rendimientos altos.[^1] Cuando la accesibilidad forma parte de la planificación estratégica, los negocios están mejor equipados para triunfar en nuestro mundo conectado de comercio, educación y compromiso civil. Echemos un vistazo a algunos ejemplos y resultados de investigaciones que le ayudarán a crear el caso de negocios más efectivo en su entorno. ## La accesibilidad es buena para los negocios Muchas organizaciones están despertando al hecho de que abrazar la accesibilidad conlleva múltiples beneficios: reducir el riesgo legal, fortalecer la presencia de la marca, mejorar la experiencia del cliente y la productividad de los compañeros. Paul Smyth, Jefe de accesibilidad digital en Barclays Las siguientes secciones exploran ventajas clave de la accesibilidad web para negocios de todo tipo. Se ofrecen ejemplos reales para mostrar cuáles son los beneficios en un mercado global. ### Impulsar la innovación La integración de la accesibilidad elimina barreras arquitectónicas, digitales y sociales que pueden ser un obstáculo para la innovación[^2]. Ejemplos: - El diseño accesible, cuando se considera, proporciona flexibilidad y variedad a los usuarios para interactuar con sitios y aplicaciones web, con opciones que son útiles para las personas con o sin discapacidad. - Cuando la accesibilidad se tiene en consideración, el diseño de la interacción del usuario se centra en las experiencias en lugar de en las pantallas. El resultado es una interacción más humana, natural y contextual. - La accesibilidad está estrechamente relacionada con la usabilidad en general. Ambas tratan de definir y proporcionar una experiencia de usuario más intuitiva. - Innovaciones tales como la máquina de escribir, el teléfono, las tarjetas perforadas, el texto a voz, el correo electrónico y los controles por voz fueron inicialmente destinadas a incluir a personas con discapacidad, pero todas ellas han encontrado un uso más amplio.[^4] - Los coches sin conductor, tan prometedores para la independencia de las personas ciegas, también prometen resolver problemas con los accidentes de tráfico y los atascos. - La investigación y el desarrollo llevados a cabo en el proyecto de una retina artificial destinada a restaurar la visión en personas ciegas también podría ayudar, en el futuro, a que los robots cuenten con sistemas de procesado de imagen en tiempo real, permitiéndoles “ver” de esta forma.[^3] El diseño accesible es flexible por naturaleza, permitiendo que el contenido sea fielmente presentado a través de un espectro amplio de dispositivos, plataformas, tecnologías de apoyo y sistemas operativos. En el entorno físico, todo el mundo se beneficia con los bordillos bajos, puertas de apertura automática, rampas y otras características para dar acceso a la discapacidad. En la web, las características de accesibilidad se convierten en opciones que también, con frecuencia, se usan ampliamente. Un ejemplo interesante se encuentra a principio de los años 2000, cuando cada vez más gente usaba dispositivos móviles para navegar por la web. Los sitios web accesibles y conformados según los estándares fueron, en muchas ocasiones, los que estuvieron mejor preparados para los móviles, pues no dependían del ratón. ¡Imagine cuál fue la alegría de quienes entonces ya se habían comprometido y diseñado teniendo en cuenta la accesibilidad! Esta revelación llevó a la tendencia del diseño web multidispositivo, el cual tiene la accesibilidad en su corazón.[^5] Los siguientes casos de estudio de dos grandes empresas tecnológicas ofrecen ejemplos útiles para empresas de todos los tamaños. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"4\" title=\"Caso de estudio: Apple \" class=\"\" %} {:/} La accesibilidad es un valor fundamental en Apple y algo que vemos como un derecho humano básico. Sarah Herrlinger, Directora de Políticas e Iniciativas de Accesibilidad Global, Apple Los ingenieros de Apple han estado innovando en el espacio de la accesibilidad desde el inicio de la empresa, con voluntad tanto para escuchar como para trabajar con partes externas. [^6] La empresa también anticipa la dirección del mercado al integrar necesidades de la discapacidad en el desarrollo del producto. Algunos ejemplos: - iTunes U: Al principio de los años 2000, el sistema de 23 campus de la Universidad Estatal de California no era capaz de beneficiarse del programa educativo de Apple, iTunes U, porque la aplicación no era totalmente accesible para los estudiantes ciegos. A los profesores de la universidad se les prohibió usarla. Esto se resolvió con innovación y no con pleitos, pues Apple escuchó las demandas de la universidad y trabajó para hacer iTunes accesible tanto desde las plataformas Mac como Windows. El sistema de la universidad estuvo en condiciones de usar el programa extensivamente. - VoiceOver en el iPhone: Al principio de la evolución del iPhone, Apple empezó a considerar cuáles serían las implicaciones que tendría un dispositivo táctil en sus clientes ciegos. Trabajando durante varios años entre bastidores, la empresa invirtió los recursos necesarios para desarrollar la tecnología de voz que desembocó en VoiceOver, el primer lector de pantallas basado en gestos del mundo. Pocas semanas después del lanzamiento, Apple recibió elogios especiales por parte de la Federación Nacional de Ciegos por “diseñar la primera interfaz táctil totalmente accesible”. [^7] Los lectores de pantalla en dispositivos táctiles son cada vez más prevalentes en la industria y Apple ha mostrado un liderazgo importante en el esfuerzo para asegurar la inclusión de todos. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} Las innovaciones en las interacciones de voz por parte de Apple y otros han contribuido a la abundancia de asistentes digitales personales que hoy se encuentran en muchas casa y oficinas. Hoy en día, millones de personas usan esos dispositivos, independientemente de sus capacidades. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"4\" title=\"Caso de estudio: Google \" class=\"\" %} {:/} Los problemas de accesibilidad de hoy son los avances principales de mañana. Eve Andersson, Directora, Ingeniera de Accesibilidad, Google Un artículo del año 2016 en la revista en línea FastCompany[^8] destaca cómo la inversión de Google en accesibilidad le proporciona a la empresa una ventaja innovadora en una gran gama de productos y servicios. Eve Andersson, la ingeniera principal y que aparece en el artículo, dice “estoy entusiasmada con la accesibilidad, no solo porque creo que hay que dar lo mejor, sino también porque hace la vida más amena para todos”. Entre las innovaciones citadas como ejemplos, se encuentran las siguientes: - Los mínimos en contraste, necesarios para las personas con baja visión, ayuda a todas las personas en situaciones con reflejos brillantes. - El autocompletado, en principio ofrecido para las personas con discapacidad, es ahora usado ampliamente por todos. - El control por voz, implementado para los usuarios con discapacidad física, ha sido adoptado más ampliamente por millones de personas al ser una ventaja. - Los avances en inteligencia artificial se basan en la investigación original que se hizo para proporcionar contexto visual a los usuarios con discapacidades visuales. - Los subtítulos automáticos que hacen uso del aprendizaje automático han sido problemáticos para los usuarios sordos destinatarios y muchos piensan que no su cubre esta necesidad de forma adecuada. Sin embargo, continuamos trabajando y el aprendizaje automático está mejorando y ha encontrado otras aplicaciones más amplias gracias a este esfuerzo. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ### Mejorar la marca Las empresas tienen que proteger y mejorar sus marcas. Un compromiso claro con la accesibilidad puede demostrar que una empresa tiene un sentido de la Responsabilidad Social Corporativa (RSC) auténtico. Aquellas empresas que comprenden y actúan según las necesidades de las partes interesadas, y que además se comprometen con prácticas de empleo y de marketing sostenibles a la vez que inclusivas, pueden obtener una serie de beneficios. Los programas de RSC pueden resultar, potencialmente, en una mejora de la marca y de la reputación, un aumento en las ventas y en la lealtad de los consumidores, una mejora en la diversidad de la mano de obra y muchos otros beneficios.[^9] Estudios adicionales[^10] enfatizan los beneficios para la marca de aquellas empresas que instauran políticas para ampliar la diversidad. Contratar a personas con discapacidad es un aspecto esencial para crear una mano de obra diversa. Para que esto sea un éxito, es necesario que las tecnologías que usan los empleados, incluyendo los sitios y aplicaciones web, sean accesibles. Barclays ha compartido su aproximación a la diversidad y a la inclusión a través de las iniciativas accesibles que han promovido y cómo esta aproximación les ha hecho una empresa mejor. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"4\" title=\"Caso de estudio: Barclays\" class=\"\" %} {:/} Establecer una estrategia organizativa para identificar, anticipar y responder a las necesidades adicionales de aquellos clientes y compañeros con discapacidad nos ayuda a construir una identidad de marca de varias formas: a través de servicios personalizados, fomentando una cultura inclusiva, creando nuevos métodos para la comunicación y la consulta con clientes existentes y potenciales. En Barclays, la accesibilidad va más allá de la discapacidad. Se trata de ayudar a todo el mundo a trabajar, tener una cuenta en un banco y vivir sus vidas independientemente de su edad, situación, capacidad o circunstancias.Paul Smyth, Responsable de Accesibilidad Digital, Barclays Queremos promover la tecnología inclusiva a fin de permitir y capacitar a todo el mundo para tener una cuenta en un banco, trabajar y alcanzar su potencial. El equipo de accesibilidad de Barclays consigue esto ayudando a los equipos digitales para incluir la accesibilidad en nuestros servicios y cultura a través de una dirección efectiva, apoyo, formación y herramientas. Establecer una estrategia de accesibilidad para toda la organización, estándares y programas junto con el respaldo de la experiencia nos permite apoyar nuestra ambición, públicamente anunciada, de convertirnos en la empresa más accesible e inclusiva del Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE). Cuando dejamos de pensar en los requisitos legales mínimos para centrarlos en las oportunidades comerciales y el desafío creativo de construir mejores experiencias para todos, es cuando creamos una aproximación a la información y servicios digitales más sostenible y orientada al cliente. Para que todo el mundo pueda entender la mentalidad accesible de Barclays, hemos creado una serie de animaciones que sirven para que nuestros compañeros sepan qué es la accesibilidad, a quién beneficia y cuáles son las diferentes discapacidades. Hemos compartido estas animaciones en nuestra [lista de YouTube Accessible Banking {% include_cached external.html %}](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLecqH2uhOR0Zb31X7hh5BzWJv4KGLnuUy). {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} Barclay demuestra cómo un compromiso sólido con la accesibilidad resulta en responsabilidad distribuida y comprensión compartida. La sensibilización sobre la accesibilidad se infiltra en la cultura de la empresa. La empresa es percibida como justa y abierta. La gente está contenta de trabajar allí y de hacer negocios con Barclays. Lea el [caso de estudio de Barclays en toda su extensión](https://www.w3.org/community/wai-engage/wiki/Barclays_Bank_Case_Study) para conocerlo mejor. Otro ejemplo bien conocido de los efectos en la marca se encuentra en Microsoft. Después de mucha presión y críticas por parte de defensores de la accesibilidad [^11], Microsoft finalmente inició un compromiso con la accesibilidad real y apreciable, demostrado por su involucración genuina con partes interesadas con todo tipo de capacidades.[^12] Las mejoras resultantes en los productos y servicios han fortalecido su imagen de marca en general [^13], y sus esfuerzos de accesibilidad son alabados en la comunidad de personas con discapacidad.[^14] ### Ampliar el alcance del mercado El mercado de las personas con discapacidad es grande y está creciendo debido al envejecimiento global de la población. En el Reino Unido, donde el mercado de personas con discapacidad es conocido como la “libra púrpura”, las personas con discapacidad y sus familias gastan al menos 249 billones de libras cada año. En los Estados Unidos, el gasto anual a discreción de las personas con discapacidad supera los 200 billones de dólares. La estimación global para el mercado de la discapacidad se acerca a los 7 trillones de dólares. Considere los siguientes hechos a la hora de estimar el tamaño del mercado: - Al menos un billón de personas – 15% de la población mundial – tiene una discapacidad reconocida. [^15] - A medida que la población envejece, muchos más adquieren alguna discapacidad, pero no se reconocen como “persona con discapacidad.” [^16] - En los países con esperanzas de vida superior a los 70 años, la gente pasa un 11,5% de su tiempo viviendo con una discapacidad. [^17] - A nivel global, se estima que el mercado extendido abarca a 2,3 billones de personas que controlan alrededor de 6,9 trillones de dólares en ingresos anuales. [^18] Una investigación de impacto económico de Forrester, encargada por Microsoft, concluyó que la accesibilidad podría ayudar a reducir costes cuando se integra en ciclos de desarrollo existentes. [^19] Las actualizaciones y los rediseños tecnológicos que incluyen la accesibilidad junto con otras buenas prácticas han demostrado reducir los costes de mantenimiento y servicio. Además, según Microsoft, a medida que se incluyen medidas de accesibilidad la satisfacción general del cliente mejora. El diseño de software inclusivo resulta en una usabilidad mejorada y satisfacción del cliente. Guía de desarrollo de aplicaciones de Microsoft Las consideraciones de diseño accesible a menudo conducen a mejoras en la experiencia del cliente en general y su lealtad. Para los clientes con discapacidad, tales mejoras son esenciales a fin de obtener un acceso igualitario. Sin embargo, la accesibilidad proporciona opciones que son útiles para todos los clientes en situaciones diferentes. Por ejemplo, la accesibilidad web también beneficia a: * La gente que usa teléfonos móviles, relojes inteligentes, televisiones inteligentes y otros dispositivos con pantalla pequeña o métodos de entrada diferentes, etc. * Personas mayores con habilidades que cambian debido a la edad. * Personas con “discapacidades temporales”, como por ejemplo un brazo roto o debido a la pérdida de las gafas. * Situaciones difíciles como el brillo de la luz solar intenso o entornos ruidosos donde no se puede escuchar un audio. * Quienes tienen una conexión lenta a internet, ancho de banda limitado o caro, lo cual es común en zonas rurales y algunas regiones geográficas. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"4\" title=\"Caso de estudio: Emisión semanal de NPR \" class=\"\" %} {:/} “This American Life” es una emisión que escuchan cerca de 2,1 oyentes cada semana en los Estados Unidos, en más de 500 estaciones de la Radio Pública Nacional (NPR). En el año 2011, en respuesta a nuevas normas sobre las emisiones de los medios por parte de la Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones (FCC) de Estados Unidos, la emisora se comprometió a crear transcripciones para su todo su archivo de programas grabados. Un estudio realizado por otro medio, llevado a cabo a lo largo de varios meses, concluyó que la provisión de transcripciones no solo cumplía con los requisitos legales, sino que también devolvía beneficios significantes como: - El tráfico de búsquedas aumentó un 6,86% - Mejor comprensión para los visitantes que usan el inglés como segunda lengua - Los visitantes podían usar las transcripciones en ambientes ruidosos o sensibles al ruido - Facilidad para realizar traducciones - Posibilidad para buscar en el texto la referencia a una sección específica del audio El estudio, llevado a cabo durante más de un año, hizo uso de Google Analytics para obtener los siguientes datos: - 7,23% de los visitantes vieron al menos una transcripción - Los visitantes únicos crecieron un 4,18% - Los enlaces entrantes a transcripciones supusieron un aumento del 3,89% Lea más información sobre el [caso de estudio de “This American Life” {% include_cached external.html %}](https://www.3playmedia.com/customers/case-studies/this-american-life/), así como el texto del estudio completo y cómo fue realizado. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ### Minimizar el riesgo legal {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" class=\"simple right\" %} {:/} Un ejemplo significante de los riesgos de ignorar la accesibilidad se encuentra en el acuerdo entre la Federación Nacional del Ciego y los grandes almacenes Target:[^20] - Daños de 6 millones de dólares - Costes judiciales del demandante superiores a los 3 millones de dólares - Costes judiciales de la defensa no revelados - Vigilancia del sitio web por parte del tribunal durante varios años {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} Considerar el coste y el riesgo de la inacción es un aspecto crucial en cualquier caso de negocios. Puesto que el uso de la web está intrincado con la vida moderna en todo el mundo, los gobiernos y jueces han empezado a promulgar leyes y políticas que refuerzan los derechos de las personas con discapacidad para participar en la información digital y los servicios en línea. Uno de los primeros ejemplos de las consecuencias legales en materia de accesibilidad web se encuentra en la denuncia interpuesta ante la Comisión de Derechos Humanos e Igualdad de Oportunidades (HREOC por sus siglas en inglés) debido a la inaccesibilidad del sitio web de los Juegos Olímpicos de Sídney. El demandante, que era una persona ciega, exponía que el sitio violaba la Ley de Discriminación contra la Discapacidad de la Mancomunidad de Naciones de 1992.[^21] La resolución del pleito de los Juegos Olímpicos, en el año 2001[^22], aumentó la sensibilización sobre la necesidad de cumplir con la accesibilidad en la emergente práctica de la comunicación web. Con el tiempo, el riesgo legal ha aumentado debido a la adopción de leyes y normas más específicas en países de todo el mundo. - La Convención sobre los Derechos de las Personas con Discapacidad (CDPD) es un amplio documento de derechos humanos que incluye una referencia directa a los derechos de toda la gente para acceder en igualdad de condiciones a las tecnologías de la comunicación. Fue aprobada por la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas y ya ha sido ratificada por más de 175 países en el año 2018. - La Comisión Europea ha adoptado la Directiva de Accesibilidad Europea, la cual exige se cumplan los requisitos de accesibilidad en cajeros y servicios bancarios, ordenadores, teléfonos y televisores, servicios de telefonía y audiovisuales, transporte, libros electrónicos y comercio electrónico. - En los Estados Unidos, las acciones legales van en aumento y la justicia decide cada vez más a favor del acceso igualitario[^23], con frecuencia citando la Ley de Estadounidenses con Discapacidades (ADA por sus siglas en inglés). La negociación estructurada es otro método efectivo de presión legal, la cual conmina a las empresas a cumplir con los requisitos de accesibilidad para evitar demandas.[^24] En Noruega es ahora ilegal que los sitios web comerciales no proporcionen acceso igualitario a las personas con discapacidad y el gobierno multa a aquellas empresas que no cumplan con esto.[^25] En Austria cuentan con leyes de protección al consumidor que desde el año 2006 exigen que la mayoría de los sitios web públicos cumplan con los estándares de accesibilidad. Los consumidores que se sienten discriminados pueden tomar acciones legales. Las partes se reúnen para llegar a un acuerdo antes de que puedan acudir a los tribunales. En los Estados Unidos, en contraste, la regulación es menos clara pero la acción legal sigue acelerándose.[^26] Entre la vigilancia gubernamental y las normas en una mano y cada vez mayor acción legal en la otra, el paisaje está cambiando rápidamente a favor del acceso igualitario. **Con los riesgos legales aumentando, las empresas inteligentes, especialmente aquellas con actividades globales, están creando políticas de accesibilidad para mitigar el riesgo y proteger tanto sus beneficios como su reputación.** {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"4\" title=\"Caso de estudio: ADA y la accesibilidad web \" class=\"\" %} {:/} El demandante ciego compró personalmente en el supermercado Winn-Dixie local y en la farmacia, pero no fue capaz de acceder al sitio web para obtener información sobre la dirección de la tienda, descuentos, eventos y ofertas especiales. La histórica demanda fue el primer juicio en la historia de la Ley de Estadounidenses con Discapacidades (ADA) relacionado con la accesibilidad de un sitio web perteneciente a un espacio público. Winn-Dixie solicitó al tribunal que desestimara la demanda basándose en su argumento de que un sitio web no es un espacio público cubierto en el Título III de la ADA. El tribunal decidió lo contrario, permitiendo que el demandante recuperara los costes judiciales. La decisión del tribunal incluía las siguientes conclusiones: - La relación entre el sitio web y las tiendas de Winn-Dixie era una circunstancia que hacía que el Título III de la ADA, relativo “espacios públicos”, fuera relevante en esta situación. - El sitio web debe ser accesible “para aquellas personas que usan ordenadores de sobremesa, portátiles, tabletas y teléfonos inteligentes”* El tribunal conmino a la cadena de supermercados a: - Adoptar y publicar una política de accesibilidad explícita “para asegurar que las personas con discapacidad puedan disfrutar del sitio web totalmente y en igualdad y deben acompañar la declaración de la política de accesibilidad con medios accesibles para presentar preguntas y problemas relacionados con la accesibilidad.”* - Llevar a cabo formación anual relacionada con la accesibilidad destinada al equipo técnico, para que estén en condiciones de crear y mantener contenido que cumpla con los criterios WCAG. - Asegurar que cualquier aplicación o contenido de terceras partes publicado por Winn-Dixie también cumpla con los requisitos WCAG. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Comparta su experiencia La investigación en la experiencia de usuario y los casos de estudio confirman las múltiples formas que tiene el diseño accesible para ayudar a una organización a innovar, mejorar su marca, aumentar el alcance del mercado y minimizar el riesgo legal, entre otros muchos beneficios. La WAI es una comunidad global basada en la práctica y le animamos a compartir sus ejemplos. Si tiene alguna historia de cómo su compromiso con la accesibilidad ha mejorado su modelo de negocio en línea, por favor envíelo a o publíquelo en [WAI-Engage wiki](https://www.w3.org/community/wai-engage/wiki/Case_studies). ## Conclusión La web se usa públicamente desde hace más de 25 años. Ya no es una novedad, sino una herramienta integrada y vital en la vida moderna. A medida que las empresas incorporan el diseño accesible en sus procesos de desarrollo y adquisición, se entiende la necesidad del acceso igualitario para todo el mundo. Los riesgos legales de ignorar la accesibilidad son importantes y los beneficios han sido demostrados por líderes como Apple, Barclays, NPR, IBM, Microsoft y cientos más. Los líderes empresariales y socios influyentes pueden causar un impacto social tremendo, a la vez que obtener un próspero retorno de la inversión, si siguen el camino del acceso igualitario. Más de un billón de personas con discapacidad en el mundo están dispuestas a interactuar como clientes, socios, empleados y participantes iguales en actividades cívicas y sociales. Al desarrollar un compromiso con la accesibilidad a largo plazo y al usar los recursos de la WAI para desarrollar políticas e implementar una estrategia para hacer efectivo ese compromiso, su negocio llegará a este mercado y es probable que tenga éxito en formas inesperadas y autosostenibles. ## Recursos Este artículo fue escrito tras leer e investigar muchos recursos externos que dieron forma a nuestra forma de entender el panorama actual.

Mi nombre es Shadi Abou-Zahra. Soy el especialista en estrategia y tecnologías de accesibilidad del W3C, el World Wide Web Consortium, y hoy me gustaría hablaros sobre la accesibilidad web. Accesibilidad Web [Shadi hablando] La Web es para mucha gente una parte esencial de su vida diaria Personas en un cibercafé En el trabajo. Alguien en una oficina usando un equipo informático En casa. Alguien sentado en un sofá usando un dispositivo portátil Y en la carretera. Alguien que usa un teléfono móvil mientras camina Accesibilidad Web significa que la gente con discapacidades pueda usar igualmente la Web. [Shadi hablando] Por ejemplo, alguien que no puede usar sus brazos, y utiliza un palo con su boca para escribir. Alguien que usa un lápiz bucal para escribir O alguien que no oye bien, y usa subtítulos para ver los vídeos. Alguien que usa un audífono O alguien que no ve bien, y usa un lector de pantalla para leer en alto lo que hay en la pantalla. Alguien que usa un lector de pantalla La accesibilidad tiene muchos beneficios. [Shadi hablando] Por ejemplo, los subtítulos nos benefician a todos en un entorno ruidoso o silencioso. Alguien que observa un video con subtítulos en una oficina Un buen contraste de color funciona mejor cuando hay reflejos. Alguien que mira un teléfono móvil con reflejos en la pantalla También se beneficia la gente con problemas relacionados con la edad, como en movilidad reducida. Alguien con temblores que usa un ratón con dificultad De hecho, cualquiera tiene una mejor experiencia de usuario con una estructura y diseño mejorados. Dos personas sonríen alegremente en un sitio web bien diseñado Se puede construir gran parte de la accesibilidad en el código subyacente de las aplicaciones y sitios web. [Shadi hablando] Las tecnologías de la Web del W3C, como HTML, ofrecen apoyo en muchas características de la accesibilidad. Código HTML de una página web Por ejemplo, para proporcionar descripciones de texto para imágenes, que son leídas en alto por los lectores de pantalla y también usan los motores de búsqueda. Código de ejemplo También otro código como las cabeceras o etiquetas apoyan la accesibilidad y mejoran la calidad en general. Código de ejemplo Las buenas herramientas de creación, como wikis, sistemas de gestión de contenido y editores de código ayudan a crear código accesible, bien de forma automática o a través del autor. Ejemplo de herramienta de creación utilizada para crear contenido web También los navegadores web, los reproductores multimedia y las aplicaciones deben ser compatibles con las funciones de accesibilidad. Ejemplo de navegador web utilizado para mostrar contenido web El W3C ofrece estándares para ayudar a hacer la Web accesible, que son reconocidos internacionalmente por gobiernos y empresas. [Shadi hablando] El más conocido son las Pautas de Accesibilidad para el Contenido Web. Las WCAG son también el estándar ISO 40500, y se han adoptado en el estándar europeo EN 301 549. Se construyen sobre cuatro principios básicos: Pautas de Accesibilidad del Contenido Web - WCAG; ISO 40500; EN 301 549 Primero, Perceptible – por ejemplo, para que las personas puedan ver el contenido u oírlo. Alguien que escribe en su tableta y lo escucha con auriculares Operable – por ejemplo, para que las personas puedan usar un equipo informático escribiendo o con la voz. Alguien hablando a su equipo informático Comprensible – por ejemplo, para que la gente entienda un lenguaje claro y sencillo. Dos personas mirando confundidas a una pantalla que muestra un sitio web denso Y Robusto - así la gente puede usar diferentes tecnologías asistivas. Alguien que usa la ampliación de pantalla en una gran pantalla Además de las WCAG, el W3C también proporciona las Pautas de Accesibilidad de Herramientas de Autor – ATAG, que definen los requisitos para los sistemas de gestión de código, editores de código y otros programas. Pautas de Accesibilidad de Herramientas de Autor - ATAG Y las Pautas de Accesibilidad de Agentes de Usuario – UAAG, que definen los requisitos para los navegadores web y los reproductores de medios. Pautas de Accesibilidad de Herramientas de Autor – UAAG Hay más de mil millones de personas con discapacidades, o alrededor del 15-20% de la población. La Convención de las Naciones Unidas sobre los Derechos de las Personas con Discapacidad define el acceso a la información, incluyendo a la Web, como un derecho fundamental. La mayoría de los países del mundo han ratificado esta convención de la ONU, y muchos de ellos también han adoptado políticas asociadas. Incluso aparte de cualquier ley o regulación, la implementación de los estándares de accesibilidad es esencial para las personas con discapacidades y es útil para todo el mundo.

Impliquer les utilisateurs dans l'accessibilité Web. L'accessibilité Web consiste à rendre vos sites et vos applications Web utilisables par des personnes en situation de handicap. Nous parlons de vos consommateurs, de vos clients, de vos employés, de vos étudiants, etc. L'accessibilité. Une personne se trouve face à un ordinateur. À côté de l'ordinateur apparaissent les mots : consommateurs ; clients ; employés ; et étudiants. Malheureusement, bon nombre de personnes considèrent l'accessibilité uniquement comme une liste de choses à vérifier. En faisant cela, elles risquent de passer à côté de la raison d'être de l'accessibilité : l'expérience utilisateur. Une liste remplace la personne. Le site Web sur l'écran s'écroule. 4 personnes remplacent l'ordinateur et la liste. Impliquer des personnes en situation de handicap tout au long des processus de conception et de développement peut s'avérer plus efficace et produire de meilleurs résultats : les designers et les développeurs apprennent comment les personnes en situation de handicap utilisent le Web, et comprennent les technologies d'assistance et les stratégies d'adaptation qu'elles utilisent ; Le groupe de personnes est entouré par des icônes au sein d'un cycle représentant le processus de développement : une icône crayon ; une icône de codage ; une icône pinceau ; et une icône loupe. Ces personnes sont intégrées en plus petit dans le processus. (suite de la liste) l'équipe chargée du projet est plus motivée lorsqu'elle comprend les conséquences positives de leur travail dans la vie des utilisateurs ; Les icônes représentant le processus sont toujours présentes et les personnes sont remplacées par une jauge de motivation. (suite de la liste) le développement est plus efficient, et vos produits fonctionnent mieux pour plus de personnes, avec ou sans handicap ; Les icônes représentant le processus sont toujours présentes et la jauge est remplacée par un graphique montrant des résultats en hausse. Le graphique est remplacé par des silhouettes de plusieurs personnes. (suite de la liste) et vos produits finaux sont plus inclusifs, touchent un public plus large, augmentent la satisfaction client, et démontrent votre responsabilité sociale. Le nombre des personnes croît et les icônes représentant le processus disparaissent. Un classement à cinq étoiles apparaît au-dessus des personnes et les cinq étoiles se remplissent. Les personnes laissent place à une Terre contenant un cœur en son milieu. \"Impliquer les utilisateurs dans les projets Web pour améliorer et faciliter l'accessibilité\" fournit des conseils pour organiser un projet, et un accompagnement tout au long du processus de conception et de développement. Impliquer les utilisateurs dans les projets Web pour améliorer et faciliter l'accessibilité. Le cycle représentant le processus de développement, qui inclut les icônes, apparaît. \"Impliquer les utilisateurs dans l'évaluation de l'accessibilité Web\" fournit une aide plus spécifique sur l'étape d'évaluation du processus. Impliquer les utilisateurs dans l'évaluation de l'accessibilité Web. Les icônes du cycle représentant le processus sont mises en avant tour à tour à l'aide d'une loupe. Ensemble, ces ressources vous aident à vous concentrer sur l'accessibilité pour les utilisateurs de votre site Web plutôt sur les seuls pré-requis techniques. \"Impliquer les utilisateurs dans l'évaluation de l'accessibilité Web\" et \"Impliquer les utilisateurs dans les projets Web pour améliorer et faciliter l'accessibilité\" fusionnent et se transforment en une personne face à l'ordinateur. Sur l'écran, les éléments accessibles et non-accessibles sont signalés. L'accessibilité Web : essentielle pour certains, utile à tous. Des icônes apparaissent autour d'un ordinateur : une main ; un œil ; un cerveau ; une oreille ; et une bouche avec des ondes sonores.

Logos du W3C et de l'Initiative pour l'accessibilité du Web (WAI) {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} ## Introduction {#intro} L'évaluation de l'accessibilité Web met souvent l'accent sur la [conformité aux standards d'accessibilité]({{ \"/test-evaluate/conformance/fr\" | relative_url }}) tels que les [WCAG]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/fr\" | relative_url }}). Bien que la conformité ait son importance, [évaluer avec de vraies personnes a de nombreux avantages (en anglais)]({{ \"/planning/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}#why){: hreflang=\"en\"}. Par exemple, pour apprendre comment votre site ou votre outil Web fonctionne réellement pour les utilisateurs, et pour mieux comprendre les problèmes d'accessibilité. Évaluer avec des personnes en situation de handicap et des personnes âgées permet d'identifier les problèmes d'utilisabilité qui ne peuvent pas être détectés uniquement avec une évaluation de conformité. Cette page fait partie d'un ensemble de pages intitulé [Évaluer l'accessibilité web]({{ \"/test-evaluate/fr\" | relative_url }}) qui offre un aperçu des différents aspects de l'évaluation de l'accessibilité Web. Il s'agit de la seconde page d'un ensemble de deux pages traitant de l'inclusion des utilisateurs dans les projets Web. **Veuillez lire [Impliquer les utilisateurs dans les projets Web pour améliorer et faciliter l'accessibilité (en anglais)]({{ \"/planning/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}, qui aborde des questions plus vastes sur l'inclusion des utilisateurs *tôt* dans la conception d'un site Web, le développement d'outils, de standards, et d'autres projets Web.** ## Premières vérifications {#prelim} Une des premières étapes pour évaluer l'accessibilité Web consiste à repérer les problèmes d'accessibilité évidents d'un site Web. À titre d'exemple, vous trouverez certaines vérifications sur [Vérifications simples – Faire un premier bilan de l'accessibilité Web (en anglais)]({{ \"/test-evaluate/preliminary/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}. Même les développeurs Web possédant peu de connaissances en accessibilité sont capables de repérer des problèmes d'accessibilité lors d'une première vérification. Un expert en accessibilité qui a une expérience directe de la manière dont les personnes en situation de handicap interagissent avec le Web peut, quant à lui : - évaluer les problèmes d'accessibilité pour un large éventail d'utilisateurs, qui n'auraient pas forcément été détectés par des utilisateurs individuels ; - aider à régler tout obstacle identifié avant d'inclure les utilisateurs ; - axer le test utilisateur sur les parties qui pourraient poser problème **La première vérification permet d'identifier les obstacles significatifs à l'accessibilité qu'il faudra régler avant l'évaluation impliquant des utilisateurs. Elle aide aussi à identifier sur quoi se concentrer lors des tests utilisateurs.** ## Types de tests utilisateurs {#range} Les utilisateurs en situation de handicap et les utilisateurs âgés peuvent être impliqués dans une grande variété d'activités d'évaluation, des consultations rapides aux tests utilisateurs à grande échelle. **Il existe plusieurs options entre ces deux extrêmes** : - **Les évaluations informelles** de problèmes spécifiques d'accessibilité peuvent s'avérer très simples. Par exemple, en demandant à quelqu'un qui utilise un lecteur d'écran ou quelqu'un avec un handicap différent de trouver des données dans une première ébauche de tableau de données. Il suffit ensuite d'observer leur interaction et d'échanger sur les différents problèmes rencontrés. - **Le test d'utilisabilité formel** d'un site Web suit des protocoles préétablis pour rassembler des données quantitatives et qualitatives provenant d'utilisateurs représentatifs qui réalisent des tâches spécifiques. [Les tests utilisateurs formels peuvent être optimisés](#ut-access) pour mettre en exergue les problèmes d'accessibilité. Le type d'évaluation à pratiquer dépend de facteurs tel que le niveau d'avancement de votre projet ; par exemple, si vous en êtes à la recherche initiale d'idées de conception, au test de zones spécifiques de vos prototypes, ou à la vérification finale de vos créations. **Mener des évaluations informelles tout au long du développement est plus efficace qu'effectuer un test d'utilisabilité formel en fin de projet.** ## Les fondamentaux {#basics} Dans la plupart des cas, inclure les utilisateurs lors de l'évaluation suppose : - d'inclure quelques utilisateurs en situation de handicap - et selon votre public cible, des utilisateurs âgés - de les inclure tout au long du développement pour effectuer des tâches types sur vos prototypes, afin de vous permettre d'identifier comment améliorer différents aspects de la conception et du code - d'échanger avec eux sur les problèmes d'accessibilité **Consultez [Impliquer les utilisateurs dans les projets Web pour améliorer et faciliter l'accessibilité (en anglais)]({{ \"/planning/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}** pour en savoir plus sur [le recrutement d'une palette d'utilisateurs](/WAI/users/involving#diverse) et sur [l'expérience des utilisateurs interagissant avec le Web](/WAI/users/involving#experience). Comme pour toute évaluation avec des utilisateurs, inclure des utilisateurs de niveau basique, intermédiaire ou avancé dépendra de vos utilisateurs cibles. Par exemple, si vous développez une application Web pour des comptables au sein d'une entreprise, vous opterez certainement pour des utilisateurs ayant un usage avancé des technologies d'assistance. En revanche, pour un site Web destiné aux demandes de prestation d'invalidité, vous travaillerez plutôt avec des utilisateurs novices dans l'usage des technologies d'assistance. Attention : Considérez avec précaution chaque contribution. Évitez de supposer que la contribution d'une personne présentant une certaine forme de handicap s'applique à toutes les personnes en situation de handicap. Une personne en situation de handicap ne sait pas forcément comment d'autres personnes présentant le même type de handicap interagissent avec le Web. Elle pourrait ne pas en savoir assez sur les autres handicaps pour fournir une aide valable pour d'autres questions d'accessibilité. Il est préférable d'obtenir des contributions de plusieurs types d'utilisateurs. À noter : en plus de détecter des problèmes d'accessibilité, l'évaluation menée avec des utilisateurs en situation de handicap révèle habituellement des problèmes généraux d'utilisabilité qui touchent tous les utilisateurs, y compris ceux qui ne se trouvent *pas* en situation de handicap. ## Analyser les problèmes d'accessibilité {#analyz} L'accessibilité Web nécessite que des [composantes multiples du développement Web et de l'interaction utilisateur (en anglais)]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} s'articulent convenablement, notamment les navigateurs Web, les technologies d'assistance, et le contenu Web. Les problèmes d'accessibilité peuvent être causés par une ou plusieurs composantes. Par exemple, si un utilisateur qui ne peut pas utiliser une souris éprouve des difficultés d'accès avec le clavier, il peut y avoir plusieurs explications : - le développeur n'a pas balisé/codé correctement la page Web, ou - le navigateur ou le lecteur multimédia ne traite pas correctement le balisage, ou - la technologie d'assistance de l'utilisateur ne traite pas correctement le balisage, ou - l'utilisateur ne sait pas comment utiliser le navigateur, le lecteur multimédia ou les fonctionnalités accessibles au clavier des technologies d'assistance, ou - la page est mal conçue et il s'agit d'un problème général d'utilisabilité touchant tous les utilisateurs, y compris ceux qui ne se trouvent *pas* en situation de handicap. ## Associez l'implication des utilisateurs et les standards {#stdstoo} Inclure les utilisateurs en situation de handicap dans l'évaluation présente de nombreux avantages. Ceci dit, cela ne suffit pas à déterminer si un site Web est accessible. Associez l'implication des utilisateurs et l'[évaluation de la conformité aux WCAG]({{ \"/test-evaluate/conformance/fr\" | relative_url }}) afin de garantir que le site est accessible aux utilisateurs pour différents types de handicaps et de situations. ## Tirer des conclusions et créer un rapport {#drawing} Soyez vigilants si vous tirez des conclusions à partir d'évaluations ou d'études limitées. Les résultats obtenus avec deux personnes en situation de handicap ne peuvent être généralisés et appliqués à toutes les personnes dans la même situation de handicap ou présentant d'autres handicaps. Retrouvez plus d'informations dans la section [Attention](#caution) ci-dessus. Incluez dans votre rapport le périmètre de votre étude et les paramètres de l'évaluation, tels que les méthodes de test et les caractéristiques des utilisateurs. Par exemple, si une étude a inclus uniquement des personnes aveugles, le rapport devra préciser que celle-ci n'a pas évalué la conformité aux standards d'accessibilité et qu'elle ne s'applique pas à toutes les personnes handicapées. Bien que les études de petite envergure peuvent souvent fournir des informations utiles, elles ne sont pas assez solides pour avoir une importance statistique. ## Note à l'attention des ergonomes {#ut-access} Lors de la recherche d'obstacles spécifiques à l'accessibilité, le protocole est généralement différent d'un test d'utilisabilité général. Par exemple : - vous utiliseriez certainement une technique de \"réflexion à haute-voix\" et une forte interaction avec l'animateur - la collecte de données s'attacherait surtout à comprendre les erreurs liées aux obstacles à l'accessibilité, plutôt que sur le temps passé à réaliser une tâche ou sur la satisfaction utilisateur - les tâches se concentreraient sur des zones spécifiques qui pourraient potentiellement poser des problèmes d'accessibilité, plutôt que sur l'utilisation générale du site Notez qu'il est également important d'évaluer d'autres facteurs pour les utilisateurs en situation de handicap. Ces facteurs comprennent : l'utilisabilité générale, la satisfaction utilisateur, et d'autres critères semblables. La section \"Plus d'informations\" ci-dessous inclut une aide supplémentaire à l'attention des ergonomes. ## Plus d'informations et de conseils {#fmi} Ce document aborde brièvement quelques points d'un sujet très complexe.

Cependant, beaucoup de sites et d'outils développés actuellement contiennent des problèmes d'accessibilité, ce qui les rend dificiles ou impossibles à utiliser par certaines personnes. Rendre le web accessible est un avantage pour les internautes, les entreprises et la société. Les standards du web internationaux définissent ce qui est nécessaire pour l'accessibilité. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"start\" title=\"Contenu de la page\" class=\"full\" %} {:/} Le contexte de l'accessibilité Qu'est-ce que l'accessibilité du Web L'accessibilité est importante pour les internautes, les entreprises, la société Rendre le Web Accessible Évaluer l'accessibilité Exemples Plus d'nformations Ressource complémentaire {% include video-link.html title=\"Vidéo : introduction à l’accessibilité web et aux standards du W3C (4 minutes)\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/videos/standards-and-benefits/fr\" src=\"/content-images/wai-intro-accessibility/video-still-accessibility-intro-16-9.jpg\" %} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Le contexte de l'accessibilité {#context} Le pouvoir du Web est dans son universalité. L'accès pour tous, quel que soit le handicap, est un aspect essentiel. Tim Berners-Lee, directeur du W3C et inventeur du World Wide Web Le web est principalement conçu de sorte qu'il fonctionne pour tous les internautes, quel que soit leur matériel, leur logiciel, leur langue, leur localisation ou leurs capacités. Si le web répond à cet objectif, il est accessible à des personnes ayant diverses capacités auditives, motrices, visuelles et cognitives. Ainsi, l'impact du handicap change radicalement sur le web car le web supprime les barrières de communication et d'interaction que rencontrent beaucoup de personnes dans le monde physique. Cependant, lorsqu'un site web, une application, une technologie ou un outil est mal conçu, il peut créer des barrières empêchant des personnes d'utiliser le web. **L'accessibilité est essentielle pour les développeurs et les organismes qui veulent créer des sites et des outils web de haute qualité, et ne pas exclure des personnes de l'utilisation de leurs produits et services.** ## Qu'est-ce que l'accessibilité du web {#what} L'accessibilité du web signifie que les sites web, les outils et les technologies sont conçus et développés de façon à ce que les personnes handicapées puissent les utiliser. Plus précisément, les personnes peuvent : - percevoir, comprendre, naviguer et interagir avec le web - contribuer sur le web L'accessibilité du web comprend tous les handicaps affectant l'accès au web, en particulier le handicap : - auditif - cognitif - neurologique - physique - de la parole - visuel L'accessibilité du web bénéficie également aux personnes *sans* handicap, comme par exemple : - les personnes utilisant un téléphone mobile, une montre connectée, une télévision connectée, et autres périphériques ayant des petits écrans, différents modes de saisie, etc. - les personnes âgées dont les capacités changent avec l'âge - les personnes ayant un « handicap temporaire » tel qu'un bras cassé ou perdu leurs lunettes - les personnes ayant « une limitation situationnelle » comme être en plein soleil ou dans un environnement où elles ne peuvent pas écouter l'audio - les personnes utilisant une connexion internet lente ou ayant une bande passante limitée ou onéreuse Voir une vidéo de 7 minutes qui contient des exemples montrant comment l'accessibilité est essentielle pour les personnes handicapées et utile à tout le monde dans un grand nombre de situations, voir : {% include video-link.html title=\"Video Les perspectives de l'accessibilité du web (YouTube)\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f31oufqFSM\" src=\"/content-images/wai-intro-accessibility/video-still-accessibility-perspectives-16-9.jpg\" %} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"3\" title=\"Plus d'informations sur ce qu'est l'accessibilité\" class=\"simple aside\" %} {:/} - Pour en savoir plus sur la façon dont différents handicaps impactent l'utilisation du web et découvrir les scénarios de personnes handicapées utilisant le web, voir la ressource [Comment les personnes handicapées utilisent le web]({{ \"/people-use-web/fr\" | relative_url }}). - Pour plus d'exemples sur les avantages pour d'autres personnes, supportés par les WCAG, voir [expériences du web partagées : les barrières communes aux personnes utilisant des appareils mobiles et aux personnes handicapées (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/shared-experiences/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} et la ressource archivée [l'accessibilité du web bénéficie aux personnes avec et sans handicap](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/archive/soc#groups). {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## L'accessibilité est importante pour les internautes, les entreprises, la société {#important} Le web est une ressource de plus en plus importante dans beaucoup d'aspects de la vie : l'éducation, l'emploi, le gouvernement, le commerce, la santé, les loisirs et plus encore. Il est essentiel que le web soit accessible afin de fournir une égalité d'accès et l'égalité des chances à des personnes avec diverses capacités. L'accès à l'information et aux technologies de communication, y compris le web, est défini comme un droit humain fondamental dans la convention des Nations Unies relative aux droits des personnes handicapées ([CRPD](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html) de l'ONU). Le web offre la possibilité d'un accès sans précédent à l'information et l'interaction de beaucoup de personnes handicapées. C'est-à-dire que les barrières d'accessibilité de l'écrit, des média audio et visuels, peuvent être plus facilement surmontées grâce aux technologies web. L'accessibilité supporte l'inclusion sociale des personnes handicapées ainsi que d'autres personnes comme par exemple : - les personnes âgées - les personnes résidant dans des régions rurales - les personnes vivant dans les pays en voie de développement **L'accessibilité représente également un gros avantage pour les entreprises.** Comme expliqué dans la section précédente, le design accessible améliore l'expérience globale et la satisfaction de l'utilisateur, en particulier, dans une variété de situations, pour différents périphériques et pour les utilisateurs âgés. L'accessibilité peut améliorer votre marque, favoriser l'innovation et augmenter votre place sur le marché.

S'il n'y a pas d'alternative textuelle à une image, l'information de l'image est inaccessible, par exemple, pour les personnes qui ne voient pas et utilisent un lecteur d'écran qui lit à haute voix l'information d'une page, comprenant l'alternative textuelle de l'image visuelle. Lorsqu'un équivalent textuel est fourni dans l'alternative textuelle, l'information est disponible pour les personnes aveugles, ainsi que celles qui désactivent les images (par exemple, dans des endroits où la bande passante est onéreuse ou lente). Elle est également disponible pour les technologies qui ne voient pas les images, comme par exemple les moteurs de recherche. ### Saisie au clavier ![sans souris](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/no-mouse.png){:.left width=\"67\" height=\"45\"} Certaines personnes ne peuvent pas utiliser de souris, y compris les personnes âgées qui ont un contrôle limité de la motricité de précision. Un site web accessible ne dépend pas de la souris ; il rend [toutes les fonctionnalités disponibles au clavier](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation.html). Ainsi, les personnes handicapées peuvent utiliser [des technologies d'assistance (en anglais)]({{ \"/planning/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}#at){: hreflang=\"en\"} qui simulent le clavier, telles que la dictée vocale. ### Transcriptions de l'audio [![exemple de transcript](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/transcript.png){:.right width=\"251\" height=\"254\"}](http://www.w3.org/WAI/highlights/200606wcag2interview.html) Tout comme les images qui ne sont pas disponibles pour les personnes qui ne voient pas, les fichiers audio ne sont pas disponibles pour les personnes qui n'entendent pa. L'ajout d'une transcription textuelle rend l'information audio accessible aux personnes sourdes, mal entendantes, ainsi qu'aux moteurs de recherche et autres technologies qui n'entendent pas. Il est facile et relativement peu cher de fournir des transcriptions sur des sites web. Il existe également des [services de transcription](http://www.uiaccess.com/transcripts/transcript_services.html) qui créent des transcriptions textuelles au format HTML. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"3\" title=\"Plus d'exemples\" class=\"simple aside\" %} {:/} - [Conseils pour débuter (en anglais)]({{ \"/tips/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} - [Tests faciles - première évaluation (en anglais)]({{ \"/test-evaluate/preliminary/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} - {% include video-link.html class=\"small inline\" title=\"Perspectives de l'accessibilité du web &mdash; videos et descriptions\" href=\"/perspective-videos/\" src=\"/content-images/wai-intro-accessibility/video-still-accessibility-perspectives-16-9.jpg\" %} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} ## Pour plus d'informations {#more-info} W3C WAI propose un grand nombre de ressources sur les différents aspects de l'accessibilité du web [standards]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/fr\" | relative_url }}), [éducation]({{ \"/teach-advocate/fr\" | relative_url }}), [test/évaluation]({{ \"/test-evaluate/fr\" | relative_url }}), [gestion de projet et politique]({{ \"/planning/fr\" | relative_url }}).

Les documents des WCAG expliquent comment rendre les contenus web plus accessibles aux personnes handicapées. Le terme « contenu » Web fait en général référence à l'information d'une page web ou d'une application web, comprenant : - les informations générales telles que le texte, les images et les sons - le code ou le balisage qui définit la structure, la présentation, etc. ## WCAG 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 {#versions} Les WCAG 2.0 ont été publiées le 11 décembre 2008.Les WCAG 2.1 ont été publiées le 5 juin 2018.La publication des WCAG 2.2 est prévue pour 2021. Toutes les exigences (« critères de succès\" ») de la version 2.0 sont incluses dans la 2.1. Les critères de succès 2.0 sont exactement les mêmes (verbatim, mot pour mot) dans la 2.1. Toutes les exigences des versions 2.0 et 2.1 seront incluses dans la version 2.2. Le contenu des critères de succès de 2.0 et 2.1 sera exactement le même dans la version 2.2. La version 2.1 comprend des critères de succès supplémentaires qui n'étaient pas dans la version 2.0. Ils sont présentés dans [Quoi de neuf dans les WCAG 2.1 (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}.Les nouveaux critères de succès proposés dans 2.2 sont présentés dans le document de travail [What's New in WCAG 2.2 Working Draft (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}. **Les contenus conformes aux WCAG 2.1 sont également conformes aux WCAG 2.0**.Et les contenus conformes aux WCAG 2.2 seront également conformes aux versions 2.1 et 2.0. (On appelle souvent cela “la rétro compatibilité”.) Un site web conforme aux WCAG 2.1 ou 2.2 devrait répondre aux exigences des politiques qui font référence aux WCAG 2.0. Dit autrement : si vous voulez vous conformer à la fois aux WCAG 2.0 et WCAG 2.1, vous pouvez utiliser les ressources des 2.1 et vous n'avez pas besoin de vous préoccuper des 2.0. Les WCAG 2.0 et WCAG 2.1 sont toutes deux des normes en vigueur. Les WCAG 2.1 ne déprécient ni ne remplacent les WCAG 2.0. Le W3C vous encourage à utiliser la version la plus récente des WCAG quand vous développez ou mettez à jour des contenus ou une politique d'accessibilité. ## À qui s'adressent les WCAG {#for} En premier lieu, les WCAG sont destinées : - aux personnes qui développent des contenus web (conception de pages, designers de sites, etc.) - aux personnes qui développent des outils pour l'édition sur le web, - aux personnes qui développent des outils pour évaluer l'accessibilité du web, - à d'autres personnes qui souhaitent ou qui ont besoin d'un standard sur l'accessibilité du web, y compris pour l'accessibilité du mobile. Les ressources liées sont destinées à répondre aux besoins de beaucoup de personnes différentes, incluant les responsables de politiques, les chefs de projets et les chercheurs, et d'autres. Les WCAG sont une norme technique, et non une introduction à l'accessibilité. Pour des documents d'introduction, voir [“Where should I start?” dans la FAQ (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/faq/\" | relative_url }}#start){: hreflang=\"en\"}. ## Que contiennent les documents des WCAG 2 {#whatis2} **[WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)** et **[WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)** sont des standards techniques stables, referenceables. Ils contiennent 12-13 règles organisées selon [4 principes : perceptible, utilisable, compréhensible et robuste](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility). Pour chaque règle, il y a des *critères de succès* à tester, qui sont sur [trois niveaux : A, AA, et AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#levels). Pour un court résumé des règles des WCAG 2, voir **[WCAG 2.1 en bref]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/fr\" | relative_url }})**. Pour en savoir plus sur les principes et les règles de l'accessibilité du web, voir **[Principes d’accessibilité]({{ \"/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/fr\" | relative_url }})**. Les documents techniques d'accompagnement des WCAG 2 comprennent : - [**How to Meet WCAG 2**: A customizable quick reference to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2 requirements (success criteria) and techniques](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) is essentially the [WCAG 2 checklist](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/). La plupart des gens utilisent cette référence rapide comme ressource principale pour travailler avec les WCAG. - **Techniques for WCAG 2** ([2.1 Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/), [2.0 Techniques](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/)) vous donnent des détails spécifiques sur la façon de développer des contenus web accessibles, tels que des exemples de code HTML. Les techniques sont « informatives », c'est-à-dire que vous n'êtes pas obligés de les utiliser. La base sur laquelle déterminer la conformité aux WCAG 2 est les *critères de succès* de la norme des WCAG 2, et non les techniques. Lire plus d'informations dans [Techniques in the FAQ (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/faq/\" | relative_url }}#techs){: hreflang=\"en\"}. - **Comprendre les WCAG 2** ([Comprendre 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/), [Comprendre 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/)) donne une aide supplémentaire pour apprendre à implémenter les WCAG 2 pour les personnes souhaitant comprendre les règles et les critères de succès plus en détail. Pour plus de détails sur ces documents et comment ils sont liés, voir **[Les documents des WCAG (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/docs/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}**. ### Traductions Les traductions autorisées et non officielles des WCAG 2 sont référencées dans [WCAG 2 Translations (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/translations/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}. ### Format des documents techniques Les documents techniques et pour comprendre les WCAG sont au format du W3C destiné aux rapports techniques, qui contient plusieurs paragraphes, au début, avec des liens vers différentes versions, auteurs, résumé et statut. ### Aide supplémentaire {#supplement} Une aide supplémentaire vous propose d'autres informations au-delà de ce qui est requis dans les WCAG 2.0 et 2.1. Elle concerne l'amélioration de l'accessibilité pour les personnes ayant des handicaps cognitifs et les personnes ayant une basse vision. Des liens vers une aide supplémentaire seront prochainement ajoutés à ce paragraphe. ## Les WCAG 2.0 sont une norme ISO/IEC 40500 {#iso} Les WCAG 2.0 ont été approuvées comme norme ISO : ISO/IEC 40500:2012. ISO/IEC 40500 est exactement la même norme que les WCAG d'origine, les WCAG 2.0, introduites ci-dessus avec les ressources d'accompagnement. Le contenu d'ISO/IEC 40500 est disponible gratuitement à [www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/); il peut être acheté dans le [catalogue ISO{% include_cached external.html %}](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=58625). Les avantages des WCAG 2.0 en tant que norme ISO sont résumés dans [ISO dans la FAQ (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/faq/\" | relative_url }}#iso){: hreflang=\"en\"}. Plus d'informations sur le W3C et le processus ISO sont dans [W3C PAS FAQ](http://www.w3.org/2010/04/pasfaq). ## Autres recommandations {#components} Les WCAG font partie d'une série de recommandations d'accessibilité qui comprennent les Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) et les User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG). [Les composantes essentielles de l'accessibilité du Web (en anglais)]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} expliquent la relation entre les différentes recommandations. ## Qui développe les WCAG {#wg} Les documents techniques des WCAG sont développés par le groupe de travail Accessibility Guidelines Working Group ([AG WG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/)) *(anciennement le Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group)*, qui fait partie du World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org)) La Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)).

Certains d’entre eux sont&#8239;: - **Les contenus web**{:#webcontent}&#8239;: ce terme s’applique à toute partie d’un site web, y compris le texte, les images, les formulaires et le multimédia, aussi bien que tout code, script, application, et ainsi de suite. - **Les agents utilisateurs**{:#useragents}&#8239;: des logiciels que l’on utilise pour accéder aux contenus web, incluant les navigateurs graphiques de bureau, les navigateurs vocaux, les navigateurs mobiles, les lecteurs multimédia, les modules d’extension (plug-ins), et certaines [technologies d’assistance]({{ \"/people-use-web/tools-techniques/fr\" | relative_url }}). - **Outils de production de contenu**{:#authoringtools}&#8239;: des logiciels ou des services que l’on utilise pour produit des contenus web, incluant les éditeurs de code, les outils de conversion de documents, les systèmes de gestion de contenus, les blogs, les scripts de bases de données, et d’autres outils. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Plus sur les standards d’accessibilité web {:.no_toc} {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Ces composants sont liés les uns aux autres et se complètent mutuellement. Par exemple, le **contenu web** doit inclure des textes alternatifs pour les images. Cette information doit être interprétée par les **navigateurs web** puis transmise aux **technologies d’assistance**, comme les lecteurs d’écran. Pour créer ces alternatives textuelles, les auteurs ont besoin **d’outils de production de contenus** qui leur permettent de le faire. Plus d’information est disponible dans [Composants essentiels pour l’accessibilité web (en anglais)]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}. Les standards jouent un rôle vital dans la définition des exigences d’accessibilité pour chacun de ces composants. Certaines exigences d’accessibilité sont facilement atteignables, cependant comprendre les bases du l’usage du Web par des personnes ayant un handicap aide à les mettre en place plus efficacement. Certains aspects de l’accessibilité réclament plus de compétences techniques ou de connaissances expertes de la façon dont les gens utilisent le Web. Dans tous les cas, [impliquer les utilisateurs dès le début et tout le long de vos projets web]({{ \"/test-evaluate/involving-users/fr\" | relative_url }}) rendra votre travail plus facile et de meilleure qualité. L’Initiative d’Accessibilité Web (WAI) fournit une liste de recommandations qui sont reconnues internationalement comme le standard pour l’accessibilité web. Elles incluent&#8239;: - **[Recommandations d’accessibilité des contenus web (WCAG)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/fr\" | relative_url }})** - **[Recommandations d’accessibilité des agents utilisateurs (UAAG) (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/uaag/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}** - **[Recommandations d’accessibilité des outils de production de contenu (ATAG) (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/atag/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}** Il existe aussi une spécification WAI pour les **[Applications internet riches accessibles (WAI-ARIA) (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/aria/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}**, qui inclut les contenus dynamiques et les contrôles d’interface utilisateur avancés développés avec Ajax, JavaScript et d’autres technologies web liées. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} ## Information perceptible et interface utilisateur {#perceivable} ### Alternatives textuelles pour les contenus non textuels {#alternatives} Les alternatives textuelles sont un équivalent des contenus non textuels. Par exemple&#8239;: - Des équivalents courts pour les images, y compris les icônes, les boutons et les graphiques - Une description des données représentées sur des graphes, des diagrammes et des illustrations - Des descriptions courtes de contenus non textuels comme les fichiers audio et vidéo - Des étiquettes pour les éléments de formulaires, de saisie, et d’autres composants d’interface utilisateur Les alternatives textuelles véhiculent le but d’une image ou sa fonction pour fournir une expérience utilisateur équivalente. Par exemple, le texte alternatif approprié d’un bouton de recherche pourrait être «&#8239;*recherche*&#8239;» plutôt que «&#8239;*loupe*&#8239;». Les alternatives textuelles peuvent être présentées sous des formes variées. Par exemple, elles peuvent être lues à voix haute aux personnes qui ne peuvent pas voir l’écran ou à des personnes ayant des difficultés à lire, elles peuvent être agrandies pour ceux qui ont personnalisé la taille d’affichage des textes, ou affichées sur des plages Braille. Les alternatives textuelles servent d’étiquettes pour les contrôles et les fonctionnalités et facilitent la navigation au clavier ou via la reconnaissance vocale (contrôle à la voix). Elles permettent aussi d’identifier les fichiers audio, vidéo et dans d’autres formats, ainsi que les applications intégrées dans un site web. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} #### Exigences d’accessibilité liées aux alternatives textuelles (liens vers les spécifications techniques, en anglais) {:.no_toc} {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} {::nomarkdown} {% include lang.html type=\"start\" lang=\"en\" %} {:/} **WCAG** - [Guideline 1.1 - Text Alternatives](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#text-equiv){: hreflang=\"en\"} **UAAG** - [Guideline 1.1 - Alternative content](https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/#gl-access-alternative-content){: hreflang=\"en\"} **ATAG** - [Principle A.1: Authoring tool user interfaces follow applicable accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#principle_a1){: hreflang=\"en\"} - [Guideline A.2.1: (For the authoring tool user interface) Make alternative content available to authors](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a21){: hreflang=\"en\"} - [Guideline A.2.2: (For the authoring tool user interface) Ensure that editing-view presentation can be programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a22){: hreflang=\"en\"} - [Guideline A.3.7: (For the authoring tool user interface) Ensure that previews are at least as accessible as in-market user agents](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a37){: hreflang=\"en\"} - [Part B.

Cependant tout le monde ne peut pas utiliser chacune de ces modalités d’entrée, ni avec la même facilité. Une considération particulière dans le design maximise le bénéfice qu’on peut tirer de ces modalités d’entrée. Par exemple&#8239;: - Les gestes qui requièrent une dextérité ou des mouvements fins comportent une alternative qui ne demande pas une grande dextérité - Les composants sont conçus pour éviter une activation accidentelle, par exemple en fournissant une fonctionnalité d’annulation - Les intitulés présentés aux utilisateurs correspondent à des noms d’objets dans le code, pour permettre l’activation à la voix - Une fonctionnalité activée par le mouvement peut aussi être activée à travers des composants de l’interface utilisateur - Les boutons, les liens, et autres composants actifs, sont assez gros pour être facilement activés au toucher En satisfaisant à cette exigence, on rend le contenu plus facile d’usage pour de nombreuses personnes avec une large gamme de compétences utilisant une large gamme de périphériques. Cela inclut le contenu présenté sur les téléphones mobiles, sur les tablettes, et sur les périphériques en self-service comme les terminaux de billetterie. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} #### Exigences d’accessibilité liées aux modalités d’entrée (liens vers les spécifications techniques, en anglais) {:.no_toc} {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} {::nomarkdown} {% include lang.html type=\"start\" lang=\"en\" %} {:/} **WCAG** - [Guideline 2.5 - Input Modalities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#input-modalities) {::nomarkdown} {% include lang.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %}{% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} #### Histoires d’utilisateurs liées aux questions de modalités d’entrée {:.no_toc} {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} - [Alex, journaliste avec un trouble musculosquelettique]({{ \"/people-use-web/user-stories/fr\" | relative_url }}#reporter) - [Yun, retraité avec une mauvaise vue, un tremblement des mains, et une perte de mémoire à court terme]({{ \"/people-use-web/user-stories/fr\" | relative_url }}#retiree) - [Luis, assistant en supermarché, atteint du syndrome de Down]({{ \"/people-use-web/user-stories/fr\" | relative_url }}#supermarketassistant) {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} ## Des informations et une interface utilisateur compréhensibles {#understandable} ### Le texte est lisible et compréhensible {#readable} Les auteurs de contenus doivent s’assurer que le contenu textuel est lisible et compréhensible par le plus grand nombre, y compris quand ce contenu est vocalisé par une synthèse vocale. Un tel contenu&#8239;: - Identifie la langue principale de la page web, par exemple arabe, hollandais ou coréen - Identifie la langue de passages de texte, d’expressions étrangères, ou d’autres partie de la page web - Fournit des définitions pour les mots, les expressions, les idiomes et les abréviations inhabituels - Utilise un langage le plus clair et le plus simple, ou fournit une version simplifiée Être conforme à cette exigence permet aux logiciels, y compris aux technologies d’assistance, d’interpréter le texte correctement. Par exemple, cette exigence aide le logiciel à lire le contenu à voix haute, à générer des résumés de pages, et à fournir des définitions pour les mots inhabituels, tel le jargon technique.

Par exemple, certaines personnes assignent des raccourcis clavier personnalisés à des fonctions qu’ils utilisent souvent pour améliorer la navigation au clavier. D’autres mémorisent les étapes à accomplir pour atteindre une page en particulier ou pour aller au bout d’un processus sur un site web.

À côté de l'ordinateur apparaissent les mots : consommateurs ; clients ; employés ; et étudiants. Malheureusement, bon nombre de personnes considèrent l'accessibilité uniquement comme une liste de choses à vérifier.

Les standards web du W3C sont appelés Recommandations du W3C. Tous les standards du W3C sont revus pour la prise en compte de l’accessibilité par le groupe de travail Architectures de plateforme accessible ([APA (en anglais)]({{ \"/about/groups/apawg/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}). Les standards du W3C et les notes de groupe de travail ci-dessous sont particulièrement pertinents pour l’accessibilité. ## Règles d’accessibilité {#guidelines} Les [Éléments essentiels de l'accessibilité du Web (en anglais)]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} montrent comment l’accessibilité du web dépend de la combinaison harmonieuse des nombreuses composantes du développement web et de l’interaction utilisateur, et comment les règles WAI (WCAG, ATAG, UAAG) s’appliquent. ### Règles pour l'accessibilité des contenus Web (WCAG) 2 {#wcag} Le « contenu » web fait référence à l’information présente dans une page ou application web, y compris : * de l’information primaire telle que du texte, des images et des sons ; * du code ou du balisage qui définit la structure, la présentation… Les WCAG s’appliquent au contenu dynamique, multimédia, « mobile »… Les WCAG peuvent aussi être appliquées aux technologies de l’information et de la communication « non-web », ainsi que décrit dans [WCAG2ICT (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/non-web-ict/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}. Informations autour des WCAG 2 : - [Vue d’ensemble des WCAG]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/fr\" | relative_url }}) - [WCAG 2.1 en bref]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/fr\" | relative_url }}) - [Comment satisfaire aux WCAG 2 (référence rapide)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) - [Traductions WCAG 2 (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/translations/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} - [Le standard WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/Translations/WCAG20-fr/) - [Le standard WCAG 2.1 (en anglais)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), [Nouveautés de WCAG 2.1 (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} - [Nouveautés de la version préliminaire des WCAG 2.2 (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} ### Règles d'accessibilité pour les outils d'édition (ATAG) {#atag} Les outils d’édition sont des logiciels et des services que les « auteurs » (développeurs web, concepteurs, rédacteurs…) utilisent pour produire du contenu web. Par exemple : des éditeurs HTML, des gestionnaires de contenu (CMS), et des sites web qui permettent aux utilisateurs d’ajouter du contenu, tels que des blogues et des sites de réseau social. Les documents ATAG expliquent comment : * rendre les outils d’édition eux-mêmes accessibles, afin que les personnes handicapées puissent créer du contenu, et * accompagner les auteurs dans la création de contenu web plus accessible.

Informations autour des UAAG : - [Vue d’ensemble des UAAG (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/uaag/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} - [Note UAAG 2.0 (en anglais)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/) ### Règles pour l'accessibilité du W3C (WCAG) 3 Projet de travail {#wcag3} WCAG 3 est un premier projet destiné à devenir une norme W3C. WCAG 3 s'applique au contenu Web, aux applications, aux outils, à la publication et aux technologies émergentes sur le Web. Informations autour des WCAG 3 : * [Introduction aux WCAG 3 (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/wcag3-intro/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} ## Spécifications techniques ### Applications internet riches accessibles (WAI-ARIA) {#aria} ARIA définit de la sémantique afin que les auteurs puissent transmettre des comportements d’interface utilisateur et de l’information structurée aux technologies d’assistance (telles que les revues d’écran). La spécification ARIA fournit une ontologie de rôles, d’états et de propriétés qui définit des éléments d’interface utilisateur accessibles. La suite ARIA comprend des spécifications de correspondance d’interface de programmation d’application (API) qui fournissent de l’accompagnement lors de l’implémentation d’agent utilisateur. Elle inclut aussi des modules pour la publication numérique et graphique. Informations autour d’ARIA : - [Vue d’ensemble de WAI-ARIA (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/aria/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} – comprend une [liste avec description de modules et de correspondances d’API (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/aria/\" | relative_url }}#versions){: hreflang=\"en\"} - [Pratiques de création WAI-ARIA (en anglais)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) - [Standard WAI-ARIA 1.1 (en anglais)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/) ### Audio et vidéo {#multimedia} - Le [format des pistes textuelles pour la vidéo web WebVTT](https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt/) est un format pour les sous-titres, les descriptions textuelles de vidéos et autres métadonnées qui sont synchronisés temporellement avec du contenu audio ou vidéo ; - Le [langage de balisage du texte synchronisé (Timed Text Markup Language TTML)](https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml/) est conçu dans la perspective du transcodage ou de l’échange d’information de texte synchronisé entre formats patrimoniaux de diffusion de contenu de sous-titrage et d’audiodescription. ### Évaluation {#eval} Les ressources suivantes favorisent le développement de méthodes et d’outils d’évaluation de l’accessibilité : - [Vue d’ensemble d’Évaluation de conformité à l’accessibilité (Accessibility Conformance Testing ACT) (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/act/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} &mdash; ACT définit et documente les règles pour tester la conformité du contenu web aux standards d’accessibilité. - [Vue d’ensemble du language d’évaluation et de compte rendu (Evaluation and Report Language EARL) (en anglais)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/earl/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} &mdash; EARL est un format interprétable par les machines pour transcrire des résultats de test.

    "text": "{::nomarkdown} {% include_cached box.html type=\"start\" h=\"2\" title=\"Summary\" class=\"full\" %} {:/} Cet article décrit les raisons pour une organisation d’intégrer l’accessibilité. Il inclut des bénéfices tangibles et intangibles, ainsi que les risques qu’on prend en ne traitant pas l’accessibilité de façon adéquate. Il montre comment l’accessibilité peut&#8239;: - Porter l’innovation&#8239;: des fonctionnalités pour l’accessibilité intégrées dans des produits et services résolvent des problèmes inattendus. - Améliorer la perception de votre marque&#8239;: les efforts de diversité et d’inclusion si nécessaires au succès de l’entreprise sont accélérés par un engagement clair et bien intégré en faveur de l’accessibilité. - Augmenter les parts de marché&#8239;: le marché global des personnes ayant un ou plusieurs handicaps est de plus d’un milliard de personnes, avec un pouvoir d’achat de plus de six mille milliards de dollars. L’accessibilité numérique augmente souvent l’expérience de tous les utilisateurs. - Minimiser le risque légal&#8239;: de nombreux pays ont mis en place des lois exigeant l’accessibilité numérique, et la question légale de l’accessibilité devient de plus en plus prégnante. Veuillez noter que les termes «&#8239;accessibilité web&#8239;» et «&#8239;sites web&#8239;» dans cet article incluent aussi les applications mobiles et web, ainsi que toute autre technologie numérique. {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached box.html type=\"end\" %} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"start\" title=\"Page Contents\" class=\"simple\" %} {:/} {::options toc_levels=\"2,3\" /} - The TOC will replace this text. {:toc} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Faut-il expliquer les bénéfices business de l’accessibilité&#8239;? Le «&#8239;business case&#8239;» est un outil nécessaire aux organisations pour prioriser leurs actions. Qu’une organisation soit commerciale, éducative, non lucrative ou gouvernementale, elle doit souvent pouvoir justifier de son investissement en argent ou en ressources pour défendre une démarche ou un but. «&#8239;Business&#8239;» dans cet article fait référence à tout type d’organisation, en comprenant bien que la pertinence de certains aspects traités sera différente selon le secteur d’activité et le but de l’organisation. Par exemple, une organisation gouvernementale peut être très motivée par des aspects légaux et d’équité. Des entreprises commerciales peuvent être persuadées quand on parle d’innovation et d’opportunités d’élargissement de la clientèle. Des organisations éducatives ou non lucratives peuvent être davantage attirées par l’amélioration de l’image de marque. Pour écrire un «&#8239;business case&#8239;» qui fonctionne pour vous, il est important de souligner les bénéfices de l’accessibilité qui sont les plus pertinents dans votre environnement professionnel. Consacrer des ressources à l’accessibilité numérique induit des bénéfices tangibles et intangibles. Un argument fréquent pour ne pas adopter l’accessibilité est que le retour sur investissement (ROI) direct est trop difficile à mesurer. Le ROI est important, bien sûr, mais ce n’est en aucun cas le seul moyen de mesurer l’impact de l’accessibilité pour une organisation quelle qu’elle soit. Un «&#8239;business case&#8239;» efficace présente aussi le coût et les risques de l’inaction. Votre organisation réagira plus probablement à un ensemble d’arguments quand vous proposerez de mettre en place un programme d’accessibilité intégré. Cet article fournit des études et des exemples pour permettre à vos décideurs d’avoir confiance en l’idée que l’accessibilité est bonne pour l’organisation. **Les entreprises qui intègrent l’accessibilité ont plus de chances d’être innovantes, inclusives, et de toucher un plus grand nombre de gens avec un message plus proche des exigences légales qui émergent dans le monde entier.** Une étude des compagnies listées par Fortune 100 montre que l’inclusion du handicap, dans le cadre d’une stratégie générale de diversité, est fréquente dans les entreprises les plus performantes.[^1] Quand l’accessibilité fait partie de la stratégie, les entreprises sont mieux équipées pour réussir dans notre monde connecté de commerce, d’éducation et d’implication civique. Regardons maintenant quelques exemples et quelques études qui vous aideront à rédiger le «&#8239;business case&#8239;» qui sera le plus efficace pour votre entreprise. ## L’accessibilité est bonne pour les affaires Bon nombre d’organisation réalisent qu’intégrer l’accessibilité amène de nombreux bienfaits en limitant les risques légaux, en renforçant la présence de la marque, en améliorant l’expérience utilisateur autant que la productivité interne. Paul Smyth, Directeur de l’Accessibilité Numérique, Barclays Les sections ci-dessous présentent les avantages clés de l’accessibilité web pour les entreprises de toutes tailles. Des exemples réels sont présentés afin de montrer comment un gain est produit à l’échelle d’un marché mondial. ### Porter l’innovation Intégrer l’accessibilité permet de faire tomber des barrières architecturales, digitales et sociales à l’innovation [^2], par exemple&#8239;: - Une conception orientée accessible rend plus souple l’interaction avec les sites web et les applications et fournit plusieurs moyens d’y parvenir, possibilités qui sont utiles aux personnes avec et sans handicap. - Quand l’accessibilité est un enjeu de conception, l’interaction utilisateur est envisagée comme ne dépendant pas seulement d’un écran. L’interaction qui en résulte est plus centrée sur l’humain, plus naturelle et contextuelle. - L’accessibilité est très liée à l’utilisabilité générale. Toutes les deux veulent définir et servir une expérience utilisateur plus intuitive. - Des innovations telles que la machine à écrire, le téléphone, les cartes perforées, la synthèse vocale, le courrier électronique et les contrôles vocaux étaient à l’origine destinées aux personnes en situation de handicap, et ont toutes trouvé une application bien plus large[^4]. - Les voitures sans chauffeur, tellement prometteuses pour l’autonomie des personnes aveugles, sont aussi considérées comme capables d’aider à résoudre les embouteillages et à réduire les accidents mortels. - La recherche et le développement de la rétine artificielle, qui projette de redonner la vue à des personnes aveugles, est envisagée pour fournir aux robots un système de traitement d’images en temps réel, leur donnant ainsi effectivement la possibilité de «&#8239;voir&#8239;»[^3]. Le design accessible est par sa nature flexible, permettant au contenu d’être restitué fidèlement sur un grand nombre d’outils, de plate-formes, de technologies d’assistance et de systèmes d’exploitation. Dans les environnements physiques, tout le monde tire profit des bords de trottoirs abaissés, des portes automatiques, des plans inclinés et d’autres aspects de l’accessibilité au handicap. Sur le Web, les fonctionnalités d’accessibilité deviennent des options utilisées souvent plus largement. Un exemple frappant nous vient du début des années 2000, quand de plus en plus de gens ont utilisé le Web sur des téléphones mobiles. Les sites accessibles et conformes aux standards étaient dans bien des cas déjà prêts pour les mobiles, parce qu’ils ne s’appuyaient pas que sur la souris. Imaginez le régal de ceux qui s’étaient déjà engagés dans une démarche accessible&#8239;! Cette révélation a mené au Responsive Design qui porte l’accessibilité en son cœur[^5]. Les cas concrets qui suivent, bien que venant de grandes compagnies dans le secteur technologique, donnent des exemples utiles à toutes les compagnies, quelle que soit leur taille. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"4\" title=\"Étude de cas&#8239;: Apple\" class=\"\" %} {:/} L’accessibilité est une valeur phare chez Apple et nous la considérons comme un droit humain de base. Sarah Herrlinger, Directrice de la Politique et des Initiatives Accessibilité Groupe, Apple Les ingénieurs d’Apple ont été des innovateurs dans le champ de l’accessibilité depuis la création de la compagnie, voulant autant écouter que travailler avec des personnes extérieures[^6]. La compagnie anticipe aussi les évolutions du marché en intégrant les besoins liés au handicap dans le développement de produits. Par exemple&#8239;: - iTunes U&#8239;: au début des années 2000, le système universitaire de Californie (CSU), fort de 23 campus, ne pouvait pas tirer profit du programme éducatif iTunes U d’Apple parce que l’application n’était pas vraiment accessible aux étudiants aveugles. Des enseignants dans le système de CSU ont reçu l’ordre de ne pas l’utiliser. Le problème a été résolu par l’innovation plutôt que par l’action en justice&#8239;: Apple a écouté les besoins de CSU et a travaillé à rendre iTunes accessible aussi bien sur les plateformes Mac que Windows. Le système CSU a bientôt pu déployer le programme. - VoiceOver sur l’iPhone&#8239;: au début de l’évolution de l’iPhone, Apple a commencé à réfléchir aux conséquences d’un écran tactile pour ses clients aveugles. La compagnie a investi dans un processus inconnu du grand public, étalé sur plusieurs années, pour développer la technologie vocale qui a mené à VoiceOver, le premier lecteur d’écran basé sur des gestes. Quelques semaines après le lancement, Apple a reçu des félicitations de la NFB (Fédération Nationale des Personnes Aveugles) «&#8239;pour avoir conçu la première interface tactile totalement accessible&#8239;» [^7]. Les lecteurs d’écran sont depuis lors présents sur un plus grand nombre d’interfaces tactiles dans l’industrie&#8239;; Apple a montré sa capacité à tracer le chemin pour assurer une inclusion pour tous. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} L’innovation dans les interfaces vocales chez Apple et ailleurs a contribué à l’abondance d’assistants numériques qu’on trouve maintenant dans de nombreux foyers et bureaux. Aujourd’hui des millions de personnes utilisent ces appareils, quelles que soient leurs capacités. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"4\" title=\"Étude de cas&#8239;: Google\" class=\"\" %} {:/} Les problèmes d’accessibilité d’aujourd’hui sont les grands progrès de demain. Eve Andersson, Directrice, Ingénierie de l’Accessibilité, Google Un article de 2016 paru dans le magazine en ligne de FastCompany[^8] souligne comment l’investissement de Google dans l’accessibilité donne à la compagnie une avance dans l’innovation pour de nombreux produits et services. Eve Andersson, ingénieure en chef citée dans l’article, dit&#8239;: «&#8239;Je suis passionnée d’accessibilité, non seulement parce que je crois que tout le monde doit pouvoir être à armes égales, mais parce qu’elle rend la vie plus vivable pour tout le monde.&#8239;» Parmi les innovations mentionnées&#8239;: - Les minimas de contraste, nécessaires pour les personnes malvoyantes, aident tout le monde à mieux voir en cas de luminosité ambiante forte. - L’auto-complétion, au départ conçue pour les personnes handicapées, est maintenant très largement utilisée par tous. - Le contrôle vocal, créé pour les utilisateurs atteints d’un handicap physique, est plus largement adopté maintenant pour sa praticité par des millions de gens. - Les progrès dans l’intelligence artificielle sont basés sur des recherches destinées à l’origine à donner du contexte visuel à des utilisateurs déficients visuels. - Le sous-titrage automatique utilisant le machine learning (l’intelligence artificielle) est encore problématique pour sa cible principale (les utilisateurs sourds) et nombreux pensent qu’il n’est pas au niveau. Cependant le travail continue et le machine learning lui-même s’améliore régulièrement, et trouve de nouvelles applications grâce à cet effort. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ### Améliorer votre image Les compagnies doivent protéger et améliorer leur image de marque. Un engagement clair en faveur de l’accessibilité peut montrer qu’une compagnie a un réel sens de la Responsabilité Sociale d’Entreprise (RSE). Quand les compagnies comprennent et agissent sur les différents besoins de leurs actionnaires, et s’engagent sur des pratiques de marketing et d’emploi durables et inclusives, elle peuvent espérer en tirer des bénéfices. Les résultats potentiels des programmes de RSE incluent une meilleure image de marque et une meilleure réputation, une augmentation des ventes et de la fidélité des clients, une diversité accrue des salariés et bien d’autres avantages[^9]. Des études plus poussées[^10] montrent le bénéfice sur la marque pour les compagnies qui ont institué une politique de diversité marquée. Employer des personnes atteintes de handicaps est essentiel dans la création d’une masse salariale diverse. Pour y parvenir, la technologie qu’utilisent les employés, y compris les sites web et les applications, doit être accessible. Barclays partage son approche de la diversité et de l’inclusion à travers ses initiatives liées à l’accessibilité, et comment cette approche en a fait une meilleure compagnie. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"4\" title=\"Étude de cas&#8239;: Barclays\" class=\"\" %} {:/} Fixer une stratégie d’accessibilité pour toute la compagne en identifiant, en anticipant et en traitant les besoins additionnels des clients et des collaborateurs handicapés contribue de plusieurs manières à notre identité de marque à travers des services sur mesure, créant une culture de l’inclusion et de nouvelles façons de communiquer et d’aider nos clients tant existants que potentiels. Chez Barclays, l’accessibilité va au-delà du handicap. Il s’agit d’aider tout le monde à travailler, à gérer ses comptes et sa vie quels que soient son âge, sa situation, ses capacités ou ses circonstances. Paul Smyth, Directeur de l’Accessibilité Numérique, Barclays Nous voulons nous appuyer sur une technologie inclusive pour permettre à tout le monde de gérer ses comptes, de vivre sa vie et d’atteindre son plein potentiel. L’équipe Accessibilité de Barclays y parvient en assistant les équipes digitales, afin d’inclure l’accessibilité dans nos services et notre culture à travers une gouvernance efficace, des partenariats, des formations et des outils. En établissant dans toute la compagnie une stratégie des standards et des programmes consacrés à l’accessibilité, de pair avec un parrainage par l’encadrement, nous pouvons appuyer notre ambition publique de devenir la compagnie la plus accessible et inclusive de toute la Bourse du Financial Times (FTSE). Quand nous passons d’une simple conformité légale minimale à une prise en compte de l’opportunité commerciale et du défi créatif de construire une meilleure expérience pour tous, nous créons une approche plus durable et plus orientée client pour nos services et notre information digitaux. Pour permettre à tout le monde de mieux comprendre l’état d’esprit orienté accessibilité de Barclays, nous avons créé une série d’animations qui aide nos collègues à comprendre ce que veut dire accessibilité, qui en bénéficie, et quels sont les différents types de handicaps. Nous avons aussi partagé ces animations sur notre [liste de lecture Youtube Accessible Banking {% include_cached external.html %}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75qKCi59E1U&amp=&list=PLecqH2uhOR0Zb31X7hh5BzWJv4KGLnuUy){: hreflang=\"en\"} (en anglais). {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} Barclays montre qu’un engagement fort envers l’accessibilité induit une responsabilité distribuée et une compréhension partagée des enjeux. La sensibilité à l’accessibilité imprègne la culture d’entreprise. La compagnie est perçue comme ouverte et respectueuse. Les employés sont fiers d’y travailler et de collaborer avec Barclays. Lisez [l’étude de cas complète sur Barclays {% include_cached different.html %}](https://www.w3.org/community/wai-engage/wiki/Barclays_Bank_Case_Study){: hreflang=\"en\"} (en anglais) pour en savoir plus. Microsoft est un autre bon exemple de la façon dont une marque peut être affectée. Après de longs débats et des critiques de défenseurs de l’accessibilité[^11], Microsoft s’est investi de façon réelle et appréciable dans l’accessibilité, par l’engagement d’acteurs de toutes capacités[^12]. L’amélioration des produits et des services qui en a résulté a consolidé son image de marque en général [^13], et ses efforts en faveur de l’accessibilité sont maintenant reconnus dans la communauté du handicap[^14]. ### Améliorer vos parts de marché Le marché des personnes handicapées est très grand et grossit encore tandis que la population mondiale se séniorise. En Grande Bretagne, où le marché du handicap est connu en tant que Purple Pound (la «&#8239;Livre pourpre&#8239;»), les personnes handicapées et leurs familles dépensent au moins 249 milliards de Livres chaque année. Aux États-Unis, la dépense spécifique aux personnes handicapées est au-dessus de 200 milliards de Dollars. L’estimation globale du marché handicap est de l’ordre de 7 mille milliards de Dollars. Pour estimer la taille de ce marché, on peut noter&#8239;: - Au moins un milliard de personnes (15&#8239;% de la population mondiale) présente un handicap reconnu[^15]. - Alors que la population vieillit, de plus en plus de personnes acquièrent des handicaps mais ne s’identifient pas pour autant comme «&#8239;personnes handicapées&#8239;»[^16]. - Dans les pays où l’espérance de vie dépasse les 70 ans, les gens passent en moyenne 11,5 pour cent de leur vie avec un handicap[^17]. - Globalement, le marché étendu est estimé à 2,3 milliards de personnes qui contrôlent un revenu annuel de 6,9 mille milliards de Dollars, en croissance[^18]. Une étude d’impact Forrester Research commissionnée par Microsoft a conclu que l’accessibilité pouvait contribuer à des économies de coûts si on l’intégrait dans des cycles de développement existants[^19]. Les mises à jour technologiques et les redesigns qui incluent l’accessibilité parmi d’autres bonnes pratiques induisent des coûts de maintenance et de service amoindris. De plus, selon Microsoft, en incluant des fonctionnalités accessibles, la satisfaction générale des utilisateurs augmente. Concevoir des logiciels inclusifs conduit à une meilleure utilisabilité et une meilleure satisfaction client. Guide de développement d’applications Microsoft Les considérations de conception accessible amènent souvent à des améliorations de l’expérience utilisateur générale et de sa loyauté. Pour des clients handicapés, de telles améliorations sont essentielles pour un accès égalitaire. Cependant, l’accessibilité fournit des options qui sont utilise à tous les utilisateurs dans des circonstances variées. Par exemple, l’accessibilité web profite aussi&#8239;: * aux personnes utilisant des téléphones mobiles, des montres connectées, des TV connectées, et autres appareils à petits écrans, dont les méthodes de saisie sont moins courantes, etc., * aux personnes plus âgées dont les capacités s’altèrent, * aux personnes atteintes de «&#8239;handicaps temporaires&#8239;», tels qu’un bras cassé ou une paire de lunettes perdue, * aux situations pénibles comme un soleil éblouissant, ou un environnement bruyant où l’audio ne peut pas être entendu, * aux personnes dont la connexion internet est lente, dont la bande passante est limitée ou chère, ce qui est commun dans les zones rurales et dans certaines régions du monde. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"4\" title=\"Étude de cas&#8239;: émission hebdomadaire de la NPR\" class=\"\" %} {:/} This American Life est une émission écoutée sur plus de 500 stations de la NPR (Radio Publique Nationale) par environ 2,1 millions de personnes chaque semaine aux États-Unis. En 2011, en réaction aux nouvelles règles liées aux médias diffusés, émises par la FCC (Commission Fédérale aux Communications), la chaîne de radio s’est engagée à créer des transcriptions de toute l’archive de leurs émissions enregistrées. Une étude menée par leur partenaire média pendant plusieurs mois a conclu que fournir des transcriptions non seulement permettait d’être conforme aux obligations légales mais donnait aussi d’autres résultats significatifs, comme&#8239;: - des accès dus aux moteurs de recherche en augmentation de 6,86&#8239;%, - une meilleure compréhension pour les visiteusr dont l’anglais n’est pas la première langue, - les visiteurs sont capables d’utiliser les transcriptions même dans des environnements bruyants ou feutrés, - une plus grande facilité à traduire, et - la possibilité de rechercher du texte pour pouvoir faire référence à une partie spécifique d’un flux audio. L’étude, menée pendant plus d’un an, a utilisé Google Analytics et donne les résultats suivants&#8239;: - 7,23&#8239;% des visiteurs ont lu au moins une transcription, - le nombre de visiteurs uniques a augmenté de 4,18&#8239;%, et - le nombre de liens entrants vers les transcriptions représente une augmentation totale de 3,89&#8239;% des liens entrants.

L’usage du Web est permanent dans la vie moderne, dans le monde entier&#8239;; les gouvernements et les législateurs commencent donc à édicter des lois et des programmes pour renforcer les droits des personnes handicapées à profiter pleinement de l’information et des services en ligne. Un des premiers exemples des conséquens légales de l’accessibilité web est la plainte déposée par la HREOC (Commission aux Droits Humains et à l’Égalité des Chances) en 2000 relative à l’inaccessibilité du site web des Jeux Olympiques de Sydney. Le plaignant, qui était aveugle, arguait que le site violait la Commonwelath Disability Discrimination Act de 1992[^21] (loi contre la discrimination envers le handicap). La décision de 2001 dans le procès contre les Jeux Olympiques de Sydney[^22] a augmenté la perception par le public de la nécessité de prendre en compte l’accessibilité web dans la pratique émergente de la communication web. Au fil du temps, le risque légal a augmenté, tandis que de plus en plus de lois et de réglements spécifiques sont adoptés dans le monde entier. - la Convention pour les Droits des Personnes Handicapées (CRDP, Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities) est un document complet sur les droits humains qui inclut une référence directe aux droits pour tous à un accès équitable aux technologies de communication. Votée par l’Assemblée Générale des Nations Unies, elle était ratifiée par plus de 175 pays en 2018. - La Commission Européenne a adopté la Loi Européenne pour l’Accessibilité (European Accessibility Law) qui exige que les points de retrait d’argent, les services bancaires, les PC, les téléphones, les équipements TV, les services audiovisuels et de téléphonie, les transports, les e-books et le commerce électronique soient conformes à des exigences d’accessibilité. - Aux États-Unis, le nombre d’actions en justice ne cesse d’augmenter et les jugements sont de plus en plus souvent en faveur d’un accès équitable[^23], souvent en référence à la Loi pour les Américains Handicapés (ADA, Americans with Disabilities Act. La Négociation Structurée est aussi une preuve de l’efficacité de la pression législative, en encourageant les compagnies à se conformer à des exigences d’accessibilité plutôt que de subir un procès[^24]. En Norvège, où il est maintenant illégal pour un site commercial de ne pas proposer un accès équivalent à une personne handicapée, le gouvernement met des amendes aux compagnies commerciales qui n’obéissent pas[^25]. L’Autriche a mis en place depuis 2006 un règlement de protection du client qui exige que la plupart des sites web publics soient conformes à des standards d’accessibilité. Les clients qui pensent être victimes d’une discrimination peuvent porter l’affaire en justice. Les parties doivent d’abord tenter une médiation avant de passer devant un tribunal. Aux États-Unis, par contraste, la règle est moins claire mais le rythme des actions en justice continue de s’accélérer[^26]. Entre la supervision gouvernementale et la régulation d’une part, et les actions en justice en augmentation d’autre part, le décor légal se transforme rapidement en faveur d’un accès équitable. **Avec l’augmentation du risque légal, les compagnies intelligentes (en particulier celles qui ont une activité mondiale) mettent en place une politique et des programmes dédiés à l’accessibilité pour limiter les risques afin de protéger tant leurs actifs que leur réputation.** {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"4\" title=\"Étude de cas&#8239;: ADA et l’accessibilité des sites web\" class=\"\" %} {:/} Le plaignant aveugle faisait ses courses en personne au magasin local de Winn-Dixie mais ne pouvait pas accéder à leur site web pour y trouver des informations telles que l’emplacement des magasins, les bons de réduction, les événements, les offres spéciales. Ce procès historique est le premier dans l’histoire de l’ADA (Loi pour les Américains Handicapés) qui traite de l’accessibilité du site web d’un service destiné au public. Winn-Dixie a demandé à la cour de ne pas donner suite, en se fondant sur le fait qu’un site web n’est pas un service destiné au public au sens couvert par le Titre III de l’ADA. La cour a tranché à l’opposée, permettant au plaignant de rembourser ses frais d’avocat. La décision inclut les conclusions suivantes&#8239;: - Le lien entre le site web et les magasins Winn-Dixie est une circonstance qui rend le Titre III de l’ADA, qui s’applique aux «&#8239;services à destination du public&#8239;», applicable à cette situation. - Le site doit être accessible aux *«&#8239;personnes en situation de handicap utilisant un ordinateur, une tablette ou un smartphone.&#8239;»* La cour a exigé de la chaîne de magasins qu’elle&#8239;: - adopte et publie une Politique d’Accessibilité explicite *«&#8239;pour s’assurer que les personnes en situation de handicap puissent profiter pleinement et équitablement du site web et devra accompagner cette déclaration publique de politique d’un moyen accessible de faire remonter des questions et des problèmes d’accessibilité.&#8239;»*&#8239;; - pratique des formations annuelles à l’accessibilité pour ses équipes informatique et web, afin qu’elles apprennent à créer et maintenir des contenus qui sont conformes aux critères WCAG&#8239;; - s’assure que toute application ou contenu tiers publié sur le site de Winn-Dixie soit aussi conforme aux exigences WCAG. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Partagez votre expérience Les études en Expérience Utilisateur et les études de cas confirment que la conception accessible augmente la capacité d’une organisation à innover, à renforcer son identité de marque, à augmenter sa part de marché, et à minimiser les risques légaux – parmi de nombreux autres bénéfices. La WAI met en commun des bonnes pratiques au niveau mondial, et nous vous encourageons à partager vos exemples. Si vous voulez raconter comment votre engagement envers l’accessibilité a amélioré votre business model en ligne, merci de nous contacter à ou d’écrire sur le [Wiki WAI-Engage {% include_cached different.html %}](https://www.w3.org/community/wai-engage/wiki/Case_studies). ## Conclusion L’appropriation du Web par le public a plus de 25 ans. Ce n’est plus une innovation mais un outil crucial, intégré dans la vie moderne. Tandis que les entreprises avisées intègrent la conception accessible dans leurs processus de développement et de sous-traitance, elles comprennent qu’il faut fournir un accès équitable à tous. Les risques légaux qu’on prend en ignorant l’accessibilité sont importants, et les bénéfices sont prouvés par des meneurs comme Apple, Barclays, NPR, IBM, Microsoft et des centaines d’autres. Les responsables d’entreprises et les personnes qui les influencent peuvent avoir un impact social phénoménal et provoquer un retour sur investissement important quand ils embarquent un plan d’action qui promeut un accès égal. Plus d’un milliard de personnes ont un handicap dans le monde et veulent interagir avec vous en tant que clients, partenaires, employés, participants à part entière de toutes les activités civiques et sociales. En vous engageant à long terme dans l’accessibilité, en vous appuyant sur les ressources de la WAI pour développer votre politique et mettre en place une stratégie pour concrétiser cet engagement, votre entreprise sera présente sur ce marché et pourra même se développer dans des directions inattendues. ## Ressources Cet article est la synthèse de nombreuses ressources qui nous ont permis de comprendre tous les enjeux. Nous fournissons des liens et des notes sur nos recherches dans cette [Bibliographie annotée]({{ \"/business-case/bibliography/\" | relative_url }}). De plus, le site de la WAI fournit un ensemble de documents utiles à l’intégration de l’accessibilité dans vos développements, vos contrats, et d’une façon générale dans vos pratiques professionnelles.

Je suis Shadi Abou-Zahra. Je suis le Spécialiste Technologie et Stratégie pour l’Accessibilité au W3C, le «&#8239;World Wide Web Consortium&#8239;», et aujourd’hui j’aimerais vous parler d’accessibilité web. Accessibilité web [Shadi parle] Le Web représente pour beaucoup d’entre nous une partie essentielle de la vie quotidienne. Des gens dans un cybercafé Au travail. Une personne au bureau travaille sur un ordinateur À la maison. Une personne dans un canapé utilise un ordinateur portable Et en déplacement. Une personne utilise un téléphone mobile en marchant L’accessibilité web permet, même avec un handicap, d’utiliser le Web comme tout le monde. [Shadi parle] Par exemple une personne n’ayant pas l’usage de ses bras a recours à une baguette buccale pour taper au clavier. Une personne tape avec une baguette buccale Quelqu’un qui n’entend pas forcément bien utilise des sous-titres pour regarder des vidéos. Une personne porte une aide auditive Quelqu’un qui ne voit pas bien utilise un lecteur d’écran pour vocaliser ce qui se passe à l’écran. Une personne utilise un lecteur d’écran L’accessibilité comporte de nombreux bénéfices. [Shadi parle] Par exemple, les sous-titres sont utiles à tous, dans un environnement bruyant ou pas. Une personne au bureau regarde une vidéo avec des sous-titres Et un bon contraste de couleurs est plus utilisable en cas de lumière vive. Une personne regarde un téléphone mobile, un reflet est visible sur l’écran De plus, elle atténue les problèmes liés à l’âge, une baisse de dextérité par exemple. Une personne qui tremble utilise une souris avec difficulté En fait, le design accessible améliore l’expérience utilisateur pour tout le monde. Deux personnes sourient devant un site web bien conçu On peut injecter beaucoup d’accessibilité directement dans le code des sites web et des applications. [Shadi parle] Les technologies web du W3C, telles qu’HTML, permettent la mise en œuvre de nombreuses solutions d’accessibilité. Code HTML d’une page web Par exemple, des méthodes pour fournir des alternatives textuelles aux images, qui sont vocalisées par les lecteurs d’écran et aussi utilisées par les moteurs de recherche. Code d’exemple De plus les titres, les étiquettes de formulaires, et autres balises aident à l’accessibilité et améliorent globalement la qualité. Code d’exemple Les bons outils de production de contenu, (wikis, gestionnaires de contenu, éditeurs de code), aident à créer du code accessible, automatiquement ou en faisant intervenir l’auteur. Exemple de manipulation d’un outil de création de contenu web De même les navigateurs, les lecteurs multimédia et les applications doivent prendre en charge l’accessibilité. Exemple de navigateur web utilisé pour afficher du contenu web Le W3C fournit des standards pour aider à rendre le Web accessible, qui sont reconnus internationalement par les gouvernements et les entreprises. [Shadi parle] Les plus connus sont les Recommandations de Contenus Web Accessibles — WCAG. Les WCAG sont aussi le standard ISO 40500, et elles ont été adoptées dans le standard européen nommé EN 301 549. Elles s’articulent autour de quatre grands principes&#8239;: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (Règles pour l’accessibilité des contenus Web) - WCAG; ISO 40500; EN 301 549 Un&#8239;: Perceptible. Par exemple, on doit pouvoir voir le contenu ou l’entendre. Une personne tape sur sa tablette et écoute dans un casque audio Opérable. On doit pouvoir utiliser l’ordinateur avec un clavier comme avec la voix, par exemple. Une personne parle à son ordinateur Compréhensible. Par exemple le texte doit être facile à lire et à comprendre. Deux personnes regardent avec un air perplexe un écran présentant un site web dense Et Robuste, afin qu’on puisse utiliser différentes technologies d’assistance. Une personne utilise une loupe logicielle sur un grand écran d’ordinateur En plus des WCAG, W3C fournit aussi les Recommandations d’Accessibilité des Outils de Production — ATAG, qui définissent des exigences pour les gestionnaires de contenu, les éditeurs de codes et d’autres logiciels. Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines - ATAG Et les Recommandations d’Accessibilité des Agents Utilisateurs — UAAG, définissent des exigences pour les navigateurs et les lecteurs multimédia. User Agent Accessibility Guidelines - UAAG Plus d’un milliard de personnes ont un handicap, soit 15 à 20 % de la population. La convention des Nations Unies sur les Droits des Personnes Handicapées stipule que l’accès à l’information, y compris au Web, est un droit humain. La plupart des pays du monde a ratifié cette convention de l’ONU et plusieurs d’entre eux ont légiféré sur le sujet. Mais même sans lois ni règlements, intégrer les standards de l’accessibilité est une nécessité pour les personnes handicapées, et est utile à tous.

The W3C list of Web Accessibility Laws &amp; Policies can help you identify policies applicable to you. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} What to include in an accessibility statement {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Accessibility statements should contain at least the following: A commitment to accessibility for people with disabilities The accessibility standard applied, such as WCAG 2.1 Contact information in case users encounter problems It is also advisable to include the following information: Any known limitations, to avoid frustration of your users Measures taken by your organization to ensure accessibility Technical prerequisites, such as supported web browsers Environments in which the content has been tested to work References to applicable national or local laws and policies Note that in some situations you may be required to provide particular content in your accessibility statements. For example, there are specific requirements for accessibility statements in relation to the EU Web Accessibility Directive {% include_cached external.html %}. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} How to write an accessibility statement {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Accessibility statements are primarily for users of your content. Usually they will refer to accessibility statements when they encounter problems. Technical and jurisdictional language will likely lead to confusion and increase the frustration rather than help your users. It is important to write in simple language, and to provide information that is useful to the users, rather than use the language of developers and lawyers. In particular, accessibility statements should explain functionality and known limitations in common terms. For example, rather than to say “WCAG Success Criterion 1.2.2 was not met”, it is better to say “videos do not have captions”. Accessibility statements are not technical assessments or declarations of conformity, though they ideally refer to such background to provide verification and increase credibility. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} Where to put an accessibility statement {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Accessibility statements should be easy to find. Linking them from several places, such as from the footer, help menu, sitemap, about page, and other prominent areas helps users to find them. Use consistent link names for your accessibility statements to help users recognize them. This includes link names across the content of your website and mobile applications, and across groups of related websites and mobile applications. For example, use the same link name on all web pages to refer to an accessibility statement for that website, and use that same link name to refer to the accessibility statement of the mobile application version of the website. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} Examples of accessibility statements {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} The following examples of accessibility statements were created using this generator tool: Example of Minimal Accessibility Statement Example of Complete Accessibility Statement Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Website Accessibility Statement {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} About this generator tool {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} This accessibility statement generator tool is designed for use in different contexts and jurisdictions.

Sayangnya, saat ini banyak situs dan sarana web yang memiliki hambatan aksesibilitas dan membuatnya menjadi sulit atau bahkan tidak bisa digunakan oleh beberapa orang. Web yang aksesibel akan memberikan manfaat bagi individu, bisnis, dan masyarakat luas. Standar internasional web memaparkan tentang syarat yang dibutuhkan untuk mencapai aksesibilitas. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::options toc_levels=\"2\" /} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"start\" title=\"Daftar Isi\" class=\"full\" %} {:/} - TOC is created automatically. {:toc} Sumber Informasi Terkait {% include video-link.html title=\"Video Pengenalan pada Aksesibilitas Web dan Standar W3C (4 menit)\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/videos/standards-and-benefits.html\" src=\"/content-images/wai-intro-accessibility/video-still-accessibility-intro-16-9.jpg\" %} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Aksesibilitas dalam Konteks {#context} Kekuatan Web ada pada sifatnya yang universal. Bisa diakses semua orang terlepas dari keterbatasan yang dimiliki seseorang adalah aspek yang esensial. Tim Berners-Lee, Direktur W3C dan penemu World Wide Web Secara fundamental, web didesain untuk bisa digunakan oleh semua orang, terlepas dari perangkat keras, perangkat lunak, bahasa, lokasi, atau pun kemampuan mereka. Ketika Web memenuhi targetnya, Web akan bisa diakses oleh orang-orang dengan kemampuan mendengar, bergerak, melihat, dan kognitif yang berbeda. Itulah mengapa dampak dari disabilitas berubah drastis pada Web, karena Web menghilangkan hambatan dalam berkomunikasi dan berinteraksi yang banyak dialami orang di dunia fisik. Namun, ketika situs, aplikasi, teknologi, mau pun sarana web didesain dengan buruk, akan tercipta hambatan yang dapat menutup akses beberapa orang dalam menggunakan Web. **Aksesibilitas esensial bagi developer dan organisasi yang ingin menciptakan situs dan sarana web berkualitas tinggi, tanpa menutup akses seseorang dari menggunakan produk dan jasanya.** ## Apa Itu Aksesibilitas Web {#what} Aksesibilitas Web berarti situs, sarana, dan teknologi web didesain dan dikembangkan agar penyandang disabilitas bisa menggunakannya. Lebih spesifik, mereka bisa: - mempersepsikan, memahami, menavigasi, dan berinteraksi dengan Web - berkontribusi pada Web Aksesibilitas web mencakup semua disabilitas yang memengaruhi akses ke Web, termasuk: - pendengaran - kognitif - neurologi - fisik - bicara - penglihatan Aksesibilitas Web juga memberikan manfaat bagi orang-orang yang *tidak* menyandang disabilitas, sebagai contoh: - orang-orang yang menggunakan ponsel, jam tangan pintar, TV pintar, berbagai perangkat dengan layar kecil, mode input yang berbeda, dsb. - lansia dengan kemampuan yang terbatas karena usia - orang-orang yang memiliki \"disabilitas temporer\" seperti tangan yang patah atau kehilangan kacamata - orang-orang yang memiliki \"batasan situasi\" seperti di bawah matahari terik atau dalam lingkungan yang tidak memungkinkan mereka untuk mendengarkan suara - orang-orang yang memiliki koneksi Internet yang lambat, atau memiliki bandwidth yang mahal atau terbatas Untuk video 7 menit dengan contoh bagaimana pentingnya aksesibilitas bagi penyandang disabilitas dan bermanfaat bagi semua orang dalam berbagai situasi, tonton: {% include video-link.html title=\"Video Perspektif Aksesibilitas Web (YouTube)\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f31oufqFSM\" src=\"/content-images/wai-intro-accessibility/video-still-accessibility-perspectives-16-9.jpg\" %} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"3\" title=\"Info Lebih Mengenai Apa Itu Aksesibilitas\" class=\"simple aside\" %} {:/} - Saat kamu ingin belajar lebih lanjut mengenai bagaimana disabilitas mempengaruhi penggunaan Web, dan membaca tentang skenario ketika penyandang disabilitas menggunakan Web, lihat [Bagaimana Penyandang Disabilitas Menggunakan Web (dalam Bahasa Inggris)]({{ \"/people-use-web/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}. - Jika Anda ingin lebih banyak contoh tentang manfaatnya bagi orang lain, dengan WCAG sebagai pendukung, lihat [Pengalaman Web Bersama: Hambatan yang Umum bagi Pengguna Perangkat Seluler dan Penyandang Disabilitas (dalam Bahasa Inggris)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/shared-experiences/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} dan arsip [Aksesibilitas Web Menguntungkan Orang Dengan dan Tanpa Disabilitas](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/archive/soc#groups). {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Aksesibilitas Penting bagi Individu, Bisnis, Masyarakat Umum {#important} Web memiliki peranan yang semakin penting dalam banyak aspek kehidupan: pendidikan, pekerjaan, pemerintahan, perdagangan, perawatan kesehatan, rekreasi, dan banyak lagi. Web harus aksesibel untuk memberikan akses dan kesempatan yang sama kepada orang-orang dengan kemampuan yang beragam. Akses ke teknologi informasi dan komunikasi, termasuk Web, didefinisikan sebagai hak asasi manusia dalam Konvensi Perserikatan Bangsa-Bangsa tentang Hak-hak Penyandang Disabilitas (PBB [CRPD](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html)). Bagi banyak penyandang disabilitas, Web memungkinkan tingkat akses kepada informasi dan interaksi yang belum pernah terjadi sebelumya. Artinya, hambatan aksesibilitas dari media cetak, audio, dan visual dapat diatasi dengan lebih mudah melalui teknologi web. Aksesibilitas mendukung inklusi sosial bagi penyandang disabilitas dan orang-orang lainnya, seperti: - lansia - orang-orang di pedesaan - orang-orang yang tinggal di negara berkembang **Terdapat kasus bisnis yang kuat untuk aksesibilitas.** Seperti yang telah ditunjukkan pada bagian sebelumnya, desain yang aksesibel dapat meningkatkan pengalaman dan kepuasan pengguna secara keseluruhan, terutama dalam situasi beragam, pada berbagai perangkat, dan untuk pengguna yang lanjut usia. Aksesibilitas dapat meningkatkan nilai merek Anda, mendorong inovasi, dan memperluas jangkauan pasar Anda.

Langkah sederhana, seperti mengubah pengaturan di browser, dapat membantu Anda mengevaluasi beberapa aspek aksesibilitas. Evaluasi komprehensif untuk menentukan apakah sebuah situs web memenuhi seluruh ketentuan dalam pedoman aksesibilitas akan membutuhkan usaha yang lebih besar. Ada beberapa sarana evaluasi yang dapat membantu Anda dalam melakukan evaluasi. Namun, alat saja tidak dapat menentukan apakah sebuah situs memenuhi pedoman aksesibilitas. Evaluasi dari seseorang yang berpengetahuan diperlukan untuk menentukan apakah sebuah situs aksesibel. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"3\" title=\"Lebih Lanjut Tentang Mengevaluasi Aksesibilitas\" class=\"simple aside\" %} {:/} - Sumber informasi yang bisa membantu dalam mengevaluasi aksesibilitas diterangkan di [Mengevaluasi Situs untuk Aksesibilitas (dalam Bahasa Inggris)]({{ \"/test-evaluate/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"examples\" %} ## Contoh {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} ### Alternatif Teks untuk Gambar ![gambar logo; HTML markup img alt='Logo Inisiatif Aksesibilitas Web'](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/alt-logo.png){:.right} Gambar harus menyertakan *[alternatif teks yang sesuai](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv.html)* (alt teks) pada markup/kode. Jika alt teks tidak disertakan pada gambar, informasi pada gambar tidak aksesibel, contohnya bagi orang yang tidak dapat melihat dan menggunakan pembaca layar, untuk membacakan informasi pada halaman termasuk alt teks pada gambar visual. Jika alternatif teks yang sesuai disertakan, informasi tersebut akan menjadi aksesibel bagi penyandang tunanetra, serta orang-orang yang menonaktifkan gambar (misalnya, di area dengan bandwidth yang mahal atau rendah). Informasi tersebut juga tersedia untuk teknologi yang tidak dapat melihat gambar, contohnya mesin pencari. ### Input Kibor ![tetikus dicoret](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/no-mouse.png){:.left width=\"67\" height=\"45\"} Beberapa orang tidak dapat menggunakan tetikus, termasuk pengguna lansia yang memiliki kemampuan motorik terbatas. Situs yang aksesibel tidak bergantung pada tetikus; tetapi menggunakan [semua fungsionalitas yang tersedia pada kibor](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation.html). Lalu para penyandang disabilitas dapat menggunakan [teknologi pembantu (dalam Bahasa Inggris)]({{ \"/planning/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}#at){: hreflang=\"en\"} yang meniru kibor, seperti input suara. ### Transkripsi Audio [![contoh transkripsi](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/transcript.png){:.right width=\"251\" height=\"254\"}](http://www.w3.org/WAI/highlights/200606wcag2interview.html) Sama seperti gambar yang tidak tersedia untuk orang-orang yang tidak dapat melihat, berkas audio juga tidak tersedia untuk orang-orang yang tidak dapat mendengar. Memberikan transkripsi teks membuat informasi audio dapat diakses oleh orang-orang yang tunarungu atau yang mengalami gangguan pendengaran, serta mesin pencarian dan teknologi lain yang tidak dapat mendengar. Mudah dan relatif murah bagi situs web untuk menyediakan transkripsi. Tersedia pula [layanan transkripsi](http://www.uiaccess.com/transcripts/transcript_services.html) yang bisa membuat transkripsi teks dalam format HTML. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"3\" title=\"Lebih Banyak Contoh\" class=\"simple aside\" %} {:/} - [Tips Memulai (dalam Bahasa Inggris)]({{ \"/tips/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} - [Pemeriksaan Mudah - Tinjauan Pertama (dalam Bahasa Inggris)]({{ \"/test-evaluate/preliminary/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} - {% include video-link.html class=\"small inline\" title=\"Perspektif Aksesibilitas Web &mdash; video dan deskripsi\" href=\"/perspective-videos/\" src=\"/content-images/wai-intro-accessibility/video-still-accessibility-perspectives-16-9.jpg\" %} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} ## Untuk Informasi Lebih Lanjut {#more-info} WAI W3C menyediakan berbagai sumber informasi tentang berbagai aspek [standar]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/id\" | relative_url }}), [pendidikan (dalam Bahasa Inggris)]({{ \"/teach-advocate/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}, [pengujian/evaluasi (dalam Bahasa Inggris)]({{ \"/test-evaluate/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}, [manajemen dan kebijakan proyek (dalam Bahasa Inggris)]({{ \"/planning/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} aksesibilitas web.

Standar Web W3C dikenal dengan nama Rekomendasi W3C. Untuk mendukung aksesibilitas, semua standar W3C ditinjau oleh Kelompok Kerja Arsitektur Platform yang Aksesibel ([APA (dalam Bahasa Inggris)]({{ \"/about/groups/apawg/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}). Standar W3C dan Catatan Kelompok Kerja yang diuraikan di bawah ini sangat relevan dengan aksesibilitas. ## Panduan Aksesibilitas {#guidelines} [Komponen Esensial dari Aksesibilitas Web (dalam Bahasa Inggris)]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} menunjukkan bagaimana aksesibilitas web bergantung pada kerja sama dari beberapa komponen pengembangan dan interaksi web, serta bagaimana pedoman WAI (WCAG, ATAG, UAAG) diterapkan. ### Panduan Aksesibilitas Konten Web (WCAG) 2 {#wcag2} \"Konten\" Web pada umumnya merujuk pada informasi dalam halaman atau aplikasi web, termasuk: * informasi standar seperti teks, gambar, dan suara * kode atau penanda yang menentukan struktur, presentasi, dll. WCAG berlaku untuk konten dinamis, multimedia, \"seluler\", dll. WCAG juga dapat diterapkan ke teknologi informasi dan komunikasi (TIK) non-web, seperti yang dijelaskan dalam [WCAG2ICT (dalam Bahasa Inggris)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/non-web-ict/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}.

Nama saya Shadi Abou-Zahra. Saya adalah Spesialis Strategi dan Teknologi Aksesibilitas di W3C, Konsorsium World Wide Web, dan hari ini saya ingin menceritakan pada Anda tentang aksesibilitas web. Aksesibilitas Web [Shadi berbicara] Web adalah bagian yang esensial dalam keseharian banyak orang. Orang-orang di warung Internet Di kantor. Seseorang di kantor sedang menggunakan komputer Di rumah. Seseorang duduk di sofa sedang menggunakan laptop Dan di jalan. Seseorang menggunakan ponsel ketika berjalan Aksesibilitas web berarti penyandang disabilitas berkemampuan sama dalam mengakses Web. [Shadi berbicara] Contohnya, seseorang yang tidak bisa menggunakan tangannya dan menggunakan tongkat mulut untuk mengetik. Seseorang menggunakan tongkat mulut untuk mengetik Atau seseorang yang tidak bisa mendengar dengan baik, dan menggunakan teks untuk menonton video. Seseorang menggunakan alat bantu pendengaran Atau seseorang yang tidak bisa melihat dengan baik, dan menggunakan pembaca teks untuk mendengarkan apa yang tertulis di layar. Seseorang menggunakan pembaca layar Aksesibilitas memiliki banyak manfaat. [Shadi berbicara] Sebagai contoh, teks bermanfaat bagi semua orang pada lingkungan yang bising atau butuh keheningan. Seseorang menonton video dengan teks di kantor Dan kontras warna yang baik akan berguna ketika ada pantulan cahaya. Seseorang melihat ponsel dengan pantulan cahaya di layarnya Mereka yang memiliki keterbatasan karena usia, seperti berkurangnya kecekatan, pun akan merasakan manfaatnya. Seseorang dengan tremor keesulitan menggunakan tetikus Faktanya, semua orang akan memiliki pengalaman menggunakan yang lebih baik dengan adanya peningkatan desain dan tata letak. Dua orang tersenyum bahagia pada situs yang didesain dengan baik Banyak unsur aksesibilitas yang dapat dibangun pada kode dasar situs dan aplikasi. [Shadi berbicara] Teknologi web dari W3C, seperti HTML, mendukung banyak fitur aksesibilitas. Kode HTML sebuah halaman web Contohnya, fitur yang menyediakan alternatif teks untuk gambar, yang bisa dibaca dengan lantang oleh pembaca layar dan juga digunakan oleh mesin pencarian. Contoh kode Begitu juga dengan judul, label, dan kode lainnya mendukung aksesibilitas dan meningkatkan kualitas secara keseluruhan. Contoh kode Sarana pembuatan yang bagus, seperti wiki, sistem manajemen konten, dan editor kode, membantu membuat kode yang aksesibel — baik secara otomatis mau pun melalui input dari penulis. Contoh sarana pembuatan yang digunakan untuk membuat konten web Browser web, pemutar media, dan aplikasi juga perlu mendukung fitur aksesibilitas. Contoh browser web digunakan untuk menampilkan konten web W3C menyediakan standar untuk membantu membuat Web yang aksesibel, yang telah diakui oleh pemerintah dan bisnis secara internasional. [Shadi berbicara] Yang paling dikenal adalah Pedoman Aksesibilitas Konten Web - WCAG. WCAG juga merupakan standar ISO 40500, dan diadopsi sebagai standar di Eropa dengan nama EN 301 549. WCAG dibangun berdasarkan empat prinsip utama: Pedoman Aksesibilitas Konten Web - WCAG; ISO 40500; EN 301 549 Pertama, Dapat Dipersepsikan - sebagai contoh, seseorang bisa melihat sebuah konten, atau mendegarnya. Seseorang mengetik dari komputer tablet dan mendengarkannya melalui headphone Dapat Dioperasikan - sebagai contoh, seseorang bisa menggunakan komputer dengan mengetik, atau melalui suara. Seseorang berbicara ke komputernya Dapat Dipahami - sebagai contoh, seseorang menerima dengan bahasa yang jelas dan sederhana. Dua orang terlihat bingung melihat layar komputer dengan situs yang padat Dan Ulet - agar seseorang dapat menggunakan berbagai teknologi pembantu. Seseorang menggunakan pembesar layar untuk membesarkan tampilan komputernya Selain WCAG, W3C juga menyediakan Pedoman Aksesibilitas Sarana Pembuatan - ATAG, yang mendefinisikan persyaratan untuk sistem manajemen konten, editor kode, dan perangkat lunak lainnya. Pedoman Aksesibilitas Sarana Pembuatan - ATAG Dan Pedoman Aksesibilitas Agen Pengguna - UAAG, yang mendefinisikan persyaratan untuk browser web dan pemutar media. Pedoman Aksesibilitas Agen Pengguna - UAAG Ada lebih dari satu miliar orang penyandang disabilitas, atau sekitar 15–20% dari populasi. Konvensi PBB tentang Hak-hak Penyandang Disabilitas menjelaskan bahwa akses pada informasi, termasuk Web, sebagai bagian dari hak asasi manusia. Sebagian besar negara di seluruh dunia telah menyepakati konvensi PBB ini, dan beberapa juga sudah mengadopsi kebijakan yang mengikat. Namun, terlepas dari peraturan maupun regulasi yang ada, menerapkan standar aksesibilitas adalah esensial bagi penyandang disabilitas, dan bermanfaat bagi semua.

ISO 40500; EN 301 549 １つ目は知覚です。これでコンテンツを見たり聞いたりすることができます。 ヘッドフォンをしてタブレットをタイプしたり聞いたりしている人 2つ目は操作性です。タイピングや音声でコンピュータを使用します。 コンピュータに向かって話しかけている人 3つ目は容易性です。明快でシンプルな言語を使用します。 難解なウェブサイトを見つめて困惑する2人 4つ目は堅牢性です。これにより、異なる支援技術を利用できます。 大きなコンピュータスクリーンを拡大鏡で見る人 加えてWCAGでは、Authoring Tool Accessibility Guideline (ATAG)も兼ね備えています。これはコードマネージメントシステムやコードエディター、他ソフトウェアの要求項目を定義しています。 Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines - ATAG またW3Cは、User Agent Accessibility Guidelines - UAAGも標準化しています。これはウェブブラウザとメディアプレイヤーの要求項目を定義しています。 User Agent Accessibility Guidelines - UAAG 世界には10億人、言い換えると、人口の15から20％の割合で障害を持つ人がいます。国連は障害者の権利条約を定めており、人権としてウェブを含んだ情報へのアクセスはほとんどの国で国連条約として批准されています。また数カ国では政策として義務付けられています。法律や規制にも関わらずアクセシビリティ標準を実行するのは、障害を持つ人たちにも、全ての人達にも不可欠なことです。 [シャディが話している] ウェブアクセシビリティの詳細はw3.org/WAIをご覧ください。 W3C Web Accessibility Initiative w3.org/WAI ## 翻訳 {#translations} 本ウェブページは翻訳を備えています。そのリンクは本ページ冒頭にあります。**動画の翻訳**には、字幕とシナリオがあります。 キャプション翻訳の入手は本動画末尾をご覧ください： 1. 選択 \"キャプション\". 2. 言語選択 翻訳されたシナリオ： 1. \"字幕を見る\"を選択 2. ドロップダウンで選択した字幕の言語を使用 ### 多言語の翻訳 W3Cは他言語の翻訳を歓迎します。[VTT file]({{ \"/content-images/wai-video-standards-and-benefits/W3C_INTRO_SFHI.vtt\" | relative_url }})の翻訳物は までお送り下さい。本ウェブページ全体や他資料を翻訳ご希望の方は[[Translating WAI Resources](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/translating/)をご覧ください。",

(예를 들어, HTML은 이미지 요소 (`img`)의 대체 텍스트 속성 (`alt`)을 정의합니다.) - **WAI 지침** ([WCAG, ATAG, UAAG는 아래를 참고하세요.](#guidelines)) - 여러 요소들에서 접근성을 위한 대체 텍스트를 어떻게 사용할지 정의합니다. - **개발자**는 적절한 대체 텍스트 내용을 작성합니다. - **저작 도구**는 웹 페이지에서 대체 텍스트 제공을 가능하게 합니다. - **평가 도구**는 대체 텍스트의 유무를 확인하는 데에 사용됩니다. - **사용자 에이전트**는 인간 기계 인터페이스에 대체 텍스트를 제공합니다. - **보조 기술**은 인간 인터페이스에 다양한 양식의 대체 텍스트를 제공합니다. - **사용자**는 필요에 따라 그들의 사용자 에이전트나 보조 기술로부터 대체 텍스트를 제공받는 방법을 압니다. ### 실행 사이클 접근성 기능이 한 요소에서 효과적으로 실행된다면, 다른 요소들도 해당 기능을 실행할 수 있을 것입니다. {% assign example_url = \"/fundamentals/components/examples/#cycle\" | relative_url %} ![실행 사이클을 보여주는 삽화. 자세한 설명은 다음 링크 참고 : {{ example_url }}]({{ \"/content-images/wai-components/cycle.png\" | relative_url }}){:longdesc=\"{{example_url}}\"} - **웹 브라우저, 미디어 플레이어, 보조 기술, 사용자 에이전트**가 접근성 기능을 지원할 때 사용자는 해당 기능을 더 요구할 것이고, 개발자들은 더 쉽게 그들의 **콘텐츠**에 해당 기능을 적용할 수 있을 것입니다. - 개발자가 그들의 **콘텐츠**에 접근성 기능을 적용하고 싶을 때 그들의 **사용자 에이전트**에 해당 기능을 더 쉽게 이용할 수 있도록 요구할 수 있습니다. - **저작도구**가 접근성 기능을 잘 실행할 수 있도록 해주었을 때 개발자들은 그들의 **콘텐츠**에 해당 기능을 더 잘 적용할 수 있을 것입니다. - 접근성 기능이 **주요 콘텐츠**에 적용되었을 때 개발자와 사용자는 **사용자 에이전트**가 지원하도록 요구하기 쉬워집니다. ### 한 요소가 약할 경우 만약 접근성 기능이 한 요소에 잘 실행되지 않는다면 접근 가능한 사용자 경험을 야기하지 않게 되고, 다른 요소들이 접근성을 실행할 이유가 없어집니다. 예를 들어, 개발자는 저작 도구가 지원하지 않고, 대부분의 브라우저와 보조 기술이 계속해서 적용하지 않는 접근성 기능은 사용하지 않으려 할 것입니다. {% assign example_url = \"/fundamentals/components/examples/#weak\" | relative_url %} ![한 요소가 약할 경우에 대한 삽화. 자세한 설명은 다음 링크 참고 : {{ example_url }}]({{ \"/content-images/wai-components/bridge.png\" | relative_url }}){:longdesc=\"{{example_url}}\"} 만약 한 요소가 접근성 지원이 제대로 이루어지지 않는다면, 다른 요소들이 더 많은 노력을 해야 하고 접근성 측면에서 전반적으로 좋지 않은 \"차선책\"을 통해 보완하고자 할 것입니다. - 개발자는 저작도구의 부족한 접근성 지원을 보완하기 위해 더 많은 작업이 필요합니다. 예를 들어, 저작 도구를 사용하지 않고 코딩하고 마크업할 것입니다. - 사용자는 콘텐츠의 부족한 접근성과 브라우저, 미디어 플레이어, 보조 기술의 부족한 접근성 지원을 보완하기 위해 더 많은 작업이 필요합니다. 예를 들어, 여러 접근성 문제를 해결하기 위해 다른 브라우저와 보조 기술을 사용할 것입니다. 그러나 대부분의 경우 차선책은 사용되지 않고, 낮은 접근성이 결과로 나타납니다. 게다가 가끔 한 요소에서의 낮은 접근성 지원은 다른 요소들로 보완하기 어렵기에 결국 낮은 접근성으로 이어지게 됩니다. 낮은 접근성은 장애가 있는 사용자가 특정 웹 사이트, 페이지, 기능에 접근하기 어렵게 만듭니다. ## 지침과 다른 표준 {#guidelines} 월드 와이드 웹 컨소시움 ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/)) 웹 접근성 이니셔티브 ([WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/))는 여러 요소들을 위한 **웹 접근성 표준**을 만들었습니다. : - [웹 저작 도구 접근성 지침 (ATAG) (영어)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/atag/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}은 저작 도구에 대해 설명합니다. - [웹 콘텐츠 접근성 지침 (WCAG) (영어)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}은 웹 콘텐츠에 대해 설명하고, 개발자, 저작 도구, 접근성 검사 도구에 주로 적용됩니다. - [사용자 에이전트 접근성 지침 (UAAG) (영어)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/uaag/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}은 보조 기술의 몇 가지 부분을 포함하여, 웹 브라우저와 미디어 플레이어에 대해 설명합니다. 이러한 접근성 지침들은 웹의 기술 명세를 기본으로 하고, 모든 W3C 기술 명세 (HTML, CSS, SVG, SMIL 등)를 참고하여 만들어졌습니다. 또한 W3C는 접근성을 주제로 한 기술 명세도 만들었습니다. 다음을 포함합니다. : * [ARIA, 접근 가능한 리치 인터넷 어플리케이션 (영어)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/aria/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}은 장애가 있는 사용자가 접근하기 쉬운 웹 어플리케이션을 만들기 위한 방법을 정의하고 있습니다.

[Shadi가 말하고 있습니다.] 예를 들어, 팔을 사용할 수 없는 사람은 타이핑을 위하여 마우스 스틱을 사용합니다. 타이핑을 위해 마우스 스틱을 사용하고 있는 사람 잘 들을 수 없는 사람은 비디오를 시청하기 위하여 자막을 이용합니다. 보청기를 사용하고 있는 사람 잘 볼 수 없는 사람은 화면에의 내용을 소리내어 읽도록 스크린 리더를 이용합니다. 스크린 리더를 사용하고 있는 사람 접근성은 많은 이점이 있습니다. [Shadi가 말하고 있습니다.] 예를 들어, 자막은 시끄럽거나 조용한 환경에서 누구에게나 장점이 있습니다. 사무실에서 자막이 있는 영상을 보고 있는 사람 좋은 색상 대비는 눈부심이 있을때 아주 좋습니다. 눈부심이 있는 휴대폰 화면을 보고있는 사람 또한 민첩함이 떨어지는 등의 노화에 따라 약화되는 것에도 도움이 됩니다. 마우스 사용에 어려움을 겪고 있는 수전증이 있는 사람 사실, 모든 사람이 향상된 레이아웃과 디자인으로 더 좋은 사용자 경험을 할 수 있습니다. 잘 디자인된 웹사이트를 보고 환하게 웃는 두 사람 접근성은 웹사이트 및 응용의 코드에 적용되어 사용됩니다. [Shadi가 말하고 있습니다.] HTML과 같은 W3C의 웹 기술은 접근성의 기능을 지원합니다. 웹 페이지의 HTML 코드 예를 들어, 이미지의 대체 텍스트를 지원하는 기능은 스크린 리더에 의하여 읽어지거나, 검색 엔진에 사용됩니다. 예시 코드 헤딩, 레이블, 기타 다른 코드들도 접근성을 지원합니다. 그리고 전반적으로 품질을 향상시킵니다. 예시 코드 위키와 같은 좋은 저작 도구, 콘텐츠 관리 시스템, 코드 편집기는 자동적으로 또는 작성자의 입력을 통하여 접근성을 위한 코드 생성을 돕게 됩니다. 웹 콘텐츠를 만들기 위해 사용되는 저작 도구 예시 웹브라우저, 미디어 플레이어 및 앱은 접근성의 기능의 지원을 필요로 합니다. 웹 콘텐츠를 보여주기 위해 사용되는 브라우저 예시 W3C는 웹 접근성이 가능하도록 돕는 표준을 제공합니다. 이는 정부와 기업에서 국제적으로 인정받고 있습니다. [Shadi가 말하고 있습니다.] 웹 콘텐츠 접근성 가이드라인으로 알려진 WCAG는 ISO 표준 40500이며, 유럽 표준으로 채택된 EN 301 549 입니다. 이것은 네가지 핵심 원칙을 기초로 만들어졌습니다: 웹 콘텐츠 접근성 가이드라인 - WCAG; ISO 40500; EN 301 549 첫번째로, 인식가능 - 예를 들어 사람은 콘텐츠를 보거나 들을 수 있습니다. 태블릿에 타이핑하고 헤드셋으로 듣는 사람 작동가능 - 사람이 타이핑이나 음성으로 컴퓨터를 사용할 수 있습니다. 컴퓨터에 말하고 있는 사람 이해가능 - 사람들이 명확하고 단순한 언어로 사용할 수 있습니다. 빽빽하게 꽉찬 웹 사이트를 보고 혼란스러워하는 두 사람 견고성 - 사람들이 다른 보조 기술을 사용할 수 있습니다. 큰 컴퓨터 화면에서 화면 확대기를 사용하고 있는 사람 WCAG 외에도, W3C는 저작 도구 접근성 지침 - ATAG를 제공합니다. ATAG는 콘텐츠 관리 시스템, 코드 편집기, 기타 소프트웨어를 위한 요구사항을 정의하고 있습니다. 저작 도구 접근성 지침 - ATAG 사용자 에이전트 접근성 가이드라인 - UAAG는 웹 브라우저와 미디어 플레이이어에서 필요한 요구사항을 정의합니다. 사용자 에이전트 접근성 가이드라인 - UAAG 10억 명이 넘는 장애인이 있으며, 이는 전세계 인구의 약 15-20%에 해당합니다. 장애인 권리에 대한 UN 협약은 인간의 권리로서 웹을 포함한 정보에 대한 접근을 정의합니다. 전 세계 대부분의 국가는 UN 협약을 비준하였고, 몇 나라는 바인딩 정책을 채택하였습니다. 어떠한 법과 규정에도, 접근성 표준의 구현은 장애인을 위한 필수적이며, 모든 사람에게 유용합니다.

Conformance Evaluation, W3C and Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) logos. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} ## Introduction Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) is an approach for determining how well a website conforms to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }})). If you want to get a general sense of how a web page addresses a few accessibility issues, see [Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility]({{ \"/test-evaluate/preliminary/\" | relative_url }}). It is usually best to do preliminary checks before applying WCAG-EM, and to address potential accessibility barriers before investing in a more thorough review such as WCAG-EM. WCAG-EM is a supporting resource for the WCAG standard; it does not define additional WCAG requirements. It is published as a W3C Working Group Note. ### Scope WCAG-EM applies to all websites, including web applications and mobile websites. It covers different situations, including self-assessment and third-party evaluation. It is independent of particular evaluation tools, web browsers, or assistive technologies. WCAG-EM is primarily for evaluating conformance of existing websites. However, accessibility should not be left until the evaluation stage; it should be integrated from the beginning and throughout the project lifecycle — in planning, design, and development. Other aspects of evaluation are addressed in related pages of the [Evaluating Web Accessibility]({{ \"/test-evaluate/\" | relative_url }}) resource suite. For example, guidance to help you better understand real-world accessibility issues and evaluate effective accessibility solutions is in [Involving Users in Evaluating Web Accessibility]({{ \"/test-evaluate/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}). Who WCAG-EM is for {#for} -------------------------- WCAG-EM is for anyone who wants a common procedure for auditing websites. It is for direct use by internal evaluators, external auditors, benchmarkers, and researchers. Additionally, WCAG-EM can be referred to by managers, procurers, policy makers, regulators, and others. Applying WCAG-EM successfully requires knowledge of WCAG, accessible web design, assistive technologies, and how people with different disabilities use the Web (as described in the WCAG-EM [Required Expertise section](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/#expertise)). What is in WCAG-EM {#whatis} ----------------------------- WCAG-EM provides guidance on using the methodology and considerations for specific situations. The conformance evaluation procedure is detailed under 5 main steps: 1. **Define the scope of the evaluation** - defining what is included in the evaluation; the goal of the evaluation; and the WCAG conformance level (A, AA, AAA). 2. **Explore the website** - identifying key web pages; key functionality; types of web content, designs, functionality, etc.; required web technologies. 3. **Select a representative sample** - guidance on structured and randomly selected web pages when it is not feasible to evaluate every web page on a website. 4. **Evaluate the selected sample** - determining successes and failures in meeting WCAG; accessibility support for website features; and recording evaluation steps. 5. **Report the evaluation findings** - aggregating and reporting evaluation findings; making evaluation statements; and calculating overall scores. ### Technical document format WCAG-EM follows the W3C format for technical specifications which includes several sections at the beginning: links to different versions, editors, copyright, abstract, and status with the link to errata and the email address for comments. There is a link at the top to the Table of Contents. WCAG-EM Report Tool {#wert} ---------------------------- The [**WCAG-EM Report Tool: Website Accessibility Evaluation Report Generator**](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/#/) helps you follow the steps of WCAG-EM and generate a structured report from the input that you provide. Who develops WCAG-EM {#wg} --------------------------- WCAG-EM is developed by the WCAG 2.0 Evaluation Methodology Task Force ([Eval TF](http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2011/eval/eval-tf)), which is a joint task force of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group ([WCAG WG](http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/)) and Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group ([ERT WG](http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/)). The Working Groups are part of the World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org/)) Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/)).",

To determine which parts you want to improve right away, and which to address in later stages, consider prioritizing: - **Key tasks**, such as registration, search, submit, or checkout processes. Include all steps involved to complete each task. - **Key content**, such as frequently accessed content and content that is relevant to people with disabilities. - **Reported content**, that has known barriers; for example, from user comments submitted through the website feedback form. - **In-development content**, such as areas of the website that are currently being redesigned, to avoid the creation of new barriers. Within your scope of repair, consider prioritizing what you repair first by focusing on: - **High-impact repairs** - Appear on multiple web pages, such as navigation bars - Appear on frequently-used web pages, such as the home page - Are critical to complete processes, such as purchase forms - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Level A issues - **Low-effort repairs** - Require less time, cost, or skills to repair - Requires less testing and validation Set your Accessibility Target Level {#target} ----------------------------------- The generally accepted target for accessibility is the latest version of [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}) Level AA. This may already be the standard specified in your organizational policy or it may be the legal requirement for your website. You may need to define a phased approach with different dates for different levels. For example, meet particular WCAG success criteria in the next release, and meet all [Level A and Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&levels=aaa) success criteria in the following release. Note that in some cases, some Level AAA success criteria may be fairly easy to meet. For example, refining appropriate link text (2.4.4, Level A) and heading structure (2.4.10, Level AAA) may be easy to address together when revising content. Tips for Efficient Repair {#repair} ------------------------- - **Leverage the different skills in your team** — While many tasks will be for developers, other roles have plenty to contribute. For example, designers can select better colors and content authors can improve the wording of links, headings, and text alternatives. The resource [Using Combined Expertise to Evaluate Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/reviewteams.html) may be helpful. - **Communicate requirements across your team** — Ensure that everyone involved in repairs understands the basics of web accessibility and the specific requirements they need to address. Distribute the [Important Resources](#resources) to the relevant members of your team. - **Validate solutions as early as possible** — Ensure that any solutions adequately address the issues raised to avoid implementing changes that do not work in practice. If at all possible, it is important to involve people with disabilities in such validation. The resources about [involving users in web projects]({{ \"/planning/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}) and [evaluating with users]({{ \"/test-evaluate/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}) provide more background. - **Optimize your Tools** — Explore and configure accessibility settings in the authoring tools you use to create web content, such as your content management system (CMS). The resources about [selecting evaluation tools]({{ \"/test-evaluate/tools/selecting/\" | relative_url }}) and [selecting authoring tools](https://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/software) may be helpful. Longer Term: Planning and Managing {#plan} ---------------------------------- Once you have addressed some of the most critical web accessibility issues on your web project, it is essential you plan to integrate accessibility throughout future design and development processes. The [Planning and Managing Web Accessibility]({{ \"/planning-and-managing/\" | relative_url }}) guide can help you develop that plan.",

Easy checks for web accessibility. Even if you are new to web accessibility and not technical, you can check some aspects of accessibility yourself. A person in front of the computer checking a website with passes and fails. The words new and non-technical are displayed. Icons around a computer: hand; eye; brain; ear and mouth with sound waves. \"Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility\" gives you step-by-step instructions to get a rough idea of the accessibility of any web page. An arrow moves from left to right to point a list of checks. For example, a web page from your own website, from your competitor, or from suppliers you might want to work with. 3 websites with different formats. It is not a complete evaluation of accessibility. More assessment by professionals is needed for a definitive and comprehensive evaluation. A computer with a website shows the progress of an evaluation as items are either marked as a fail or pass. Sometimes doing just a few of these checks can give you an indication of the overall accessibility. Fails and passes stand out. Some checks are simple. For example, looking at the title of the web page displayed in the browser window. Web page title is highlighted. You can do most of the checks using any web browser. Some checks are easier using an extension for your browser. A browser extension is downloaded. Start your accessibility journey right now by doing some Easy Checks. A map with a route and an accessibility flag at the end. Web accessibility: essential for some, useful for all. Icons around a computer: hand; eye; brain; ear; and mouth with sound waves.

These sections are hidden by default so they don't clutter the page. You can expand them to see the information. The headings of hidden sections have a plus button [+] before them. Screen readers will say something like: &quot;+ Section title, button collapsed&quot;. To get the hidden information, click the button or click anywhere on the heading. The sections below all have hidden information under expandable headings. The first time you read this page, we recommend that you expand the headings of these five sections and read them. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} Tools: WebDev Toolbar and IE WAT (optional) {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} You can do most of these checks with any browser, that is, you do not need to download special tools. However, some checks are easier if you can download tools. To keep it simple, we&#39;ve included instructions for just two tools: the Web Developer Toolbar for Chrome, Opera, and Firefox (&quot;WebDev Toolbar&quot;) and the Web Accessibility Toolbar for Internet Explorer (&quot;IE WAT&quot;). Both are free extensions/add-ons available in different languages. WebDev Toolbar - To do the checks that are indicated &quot;with the WebDev Toolbar&quot;, you&#39;ll need either the Chrome browser and the Web Developer extension for Chrome the Opera browser and the Web Developer extension for Opera the Firefox browser and the Web Developer extension/add-on for Firefox IE WAT - To do the checks that are indicated &quot;with IE WAT&quot;, you&#39;ll need the Internet Explorer (IE) browser version 9 or later and the Web Accessibility Toolbar version 19 July 2013 or later. Note that we&#39;re not endorsing these tools over others. There are many other useful tools to help with evaluation. (If you can&#39;t download these tools, that&#39;s OK; you can still do the checks indicated &quot;with any browser&quot;.) {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %}{% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} WCAG links {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} These checks are based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The main points in WCAG are called &quot;Success Criteria&quot;. In the &quot;Learn more from&quot; sections of this page, there are links to pages that explain the relevant success criteria in the &quot;Understanding WCAG&quot; document. Please see the {% include link.html to=\"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" text=\"WCAG Overview\" %} for an introduction to WCAG. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %}{% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} Practicing with BAD, the Before-After Demo {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} The Before and After Demonstration (BAD) from W3C WAI shows an inaccessible website and a retrofitted version of this same website with the accessibility barriers fixed. You can use the BAD pages to learn how to do these checks. For example, first, do the check on an accessible version of a page to see what it should look like. Then, do the check on the corresponding inaccessible page to see what it looks like when there are accessibility barriers. The BAD pages have annotations that are notes on what is accessible and not accessible in the demo pages. To turn on annotations, click &quot;Show Annotations&quot; in the yellow box near the top, middle of the page; then click a number and a box titled &quot;Note ##&quot; will open with the explanation. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %}{% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} Background {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} These checks are designed for anyone who can use the web. You don&#39;t need much knowledge or skill. Some of the checks require seeing the web page or hearing the audio. However, there are many things that anyone can check. Here are some things to know that will help you understand the brief explanations throughout this page: markup refers to web page code, called HTML. You can see the markup of a web page in most browsers by selecting from the menu: View &gt; Source. You do not need to look at the markup to do these checks; however, it does help to understand what &quot;markup&quot; and &quot;marked up&quot; means. assistive technologies (AT) are software or hardware that people with disabilities use to improve interaction with the web. screen readers are software that reads aloud the information in web pages and enables keyboard navigation. They are used by people who are blind. voice input is using speech instead of a keyboard and mouse. To learn more, see: {% include link.html to=\"/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/\" fallback=\"Introduction to Web Accessibility\" %} {% include link.html to=\"/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/\" text=\"Accessibility Principles\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %}{% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} Keyboard instructions: Ctrl for Windows, cmd for Mac {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Some of the keyboard instructions are different for Windows and Mac; for example, &quot;Ctrl&quot; versus &quot;cmd&quot; in: For Windows: With the keyboard: Ctrl+Alt+6, then down arrow key to &quot;Heading structure&quot;. For Mac: With the keyboard: cmd+Alt+6, then down arrow key to &quot;Heading structure&quot;. To reduce clutter, these are listed as: With the keyboard: Ctrl/cmd+Alt+6, then down arrow key to &quot;Heading structure&quot;. For such instructions, Windows users press the Ctrl key, and Mac users press the cmd key. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} Page title Page titles are: shown in the window title bar in some browsers shown in browsers' tabs when there are multiple web pages open shown in search engine results used for browser bookmarks/favorites read by screen readers (In the web page markup they are the &lt;title&gt; within the &lt;head&gt;.) The image below shows the page title &quot;Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility&quot; in the title bar, and the titles of 4 pages in the tabs. Note that in the tabs, only the first part of the page title is shown. Figure: Firefox browser with full title in the title bar and partial titles in the tabs. Good page titles are particularly important for orientation — to help people know where they are and move between pages open in their browser. The first thing screen readers say when the user goes to a different web page is the page title. What to do: Look at the page&#39;s title (or with a screen reader, listen to it). Look at titles of other pages within the website. What to check for: Check that there is a title that adequately and briefly describes the content of the page. Check that the title is different from other pages on the website, and adequately distinguishes the page from other web pages. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"titletips\" %} Tips {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} There is flexibility on what makes a good page title. Best practice is for titles to be &quot;front-loaded&quot; with the important and unique identifying information first. For example: Poor titles: Welcome to home page of Acme Web Solutions, Inc. Acme Web Solutions, Inc. | About Us Acme Web Solutions, Inc. | Contact Us Acme Web Solutions, Inc. | History Better page titles: Acme Web Solutions home page About Acme Web Solutions Contact Acme Web Solutions History of Acme Web Solutions {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} Page title checks {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} To check page title with different browsers {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} If you have a browser that displays the page title in the window title bar by default, use that browser. Some versions of Firefox, Safari, Opera, and older versions of IE show the title by default. Firefox on Windows: If the title bar isn't displayed you might be able to display it by pressing: Alt+V, T, M (or right-mouse click in the empty area after the tab and select Menu Bar). If your browser doesn't have a title bar, you can do try one of these: With your mouse, hover over the browser tab to see the full page title, like this: Figure: Page title in popup, displayed with mouse hover over tab. Display the Add Bookmark dialog box, which includes the title. In some Windows browsers, press Ctrl+D. In some Mac browsers, press cmd+D to get the Add Bookmark dialog box. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} To check page title with IE WAT {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} (Some versions of IE have the title bar so you can just look there, you don't need to do the steps below.) Open the web page you are checking. In the toolbar, select &quot;Structure&quot;, then &quot;Heading structure&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Ctrl/cmd+Alt+6, then down arrow key to &quot;Heading structure&quot;. A new page opens. The page title is shown after &quot;Title:&quot;. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} Learn more about page titles {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Page Titled - Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.2 for WCAG (Level A) {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} Image text alternatives (&quot;alt text&quot;) Text alternatives (&quot;alt text&quot;) convey the purpose of an image, including pictures, illustrations, charts, etc. Text alternatives are used by people who do not see the image. (For example, people who are blind and use screen readers can hear the alt text read out; and people who have turned off images to speed download or save bandwidth can see the alt text.) The text should be functional and provide an equivalent user experience, not necessarily describe the image. (For example, appropriate text alternative for a search button would be &quot;search&quot;, not &quot;magnifying glass&quot;.) You don&#39;t usually see the alt text on a web page, it is in the web page markup (like this: &lt;img src=&quot;pointer_to_image.png&quot; alt=&quot;here's where the alternative text goes&quot;&gt;). Every image should include alt in the markup. If an image conveys information useful for interacting with or understanding the web page content, then it needs alternative text. If an image is just decorative and people don&#39;t need to know about the image, then it should have null alt (alt=&quot;&quot;). Automated tests can tell you if alt is missing. To determine if the alternative text is appropriate, you need to see the image and judge it in context. What to check for: Every image has alt with appropriate alternative text. Tips Appropriate alternative text is not an exact science. Some people prefer most images to have more detailed description; and others prefer much less description. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} Appropriate alt text: {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} The text needs to convey the same meaning as the image. That is, if someone cannot see the image, they get the important information from the image in the alternative text. Alternative text depends on context. For example, for an image of a dog on a kennel club website, the alt text might include the breed of the dog; however, the same image on a dog park website may be there just to make the page more attractive, and the image might not need any alt text (and should have null alt). One way to help think about appropriate alt text is: if you were helping someone read and interact with the web page and they cannot see it, what would you say about the image? Images that are functional — for example, images that initiate actions (like submit buttons) and linked images (like in navigation) — need alt text that is the functional equivalent. If there is text in the image — for example, in a logo — that text needs to be included in the alt text. If the image has complex information — such as charts or graphs — the image should have a short alt text to identify the image, and then the detailed description of the information should be provided elsewhere (for example, in a data table). {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} What is not needed in the alt text: {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} If the image is not important for understanding the content — for example, it is just decoration or &quot;eye candy&quot; — it should have null alt (alt=&quot;&quot;). One way to help determine if an image should have null alt is to ask yourself: If the image was removed, would the user still get all the information from the page? The alternative text does not need to include the words &quot;button&quot;, &quot;link&quot;, or &quot;image of&quot;. (Screen readers automatically provide that information.) If the image is sufficiently described in the text — for example, a simple diagram illustrating what&#39;s written in the web page text — it can have brief alt text such as &quot;Diagram of work flow as describe above.&quot; {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} alt attribute in HTML (not &quot;alt tag&quot;) {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} In HTML (which is web page code, called markup), alt is an attribute of the image element, and other elements. (So &quot;alt tag&quot; is technically incorrect; the correct terminology is &quot;alt attribute&quot;, or you can say &quot;alt text&quot;.) It looks like this in markup: &lt;img alt=&quot;WAI logo&quot; src=&quot;/wai/logo.png&quot;&gt; {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} Alt text checks There are three options to check alt text listed below. The first one is the easiest, if you have the IE WAT toolbar. If you don&#39;t have any toolbars, there is a check at the end for any browser. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} To check alt text with IE WAT {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Open the web page you are checking. In the toolbar, select &quot;Images&quot;, then &quot;Show Images&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Ctrl/cmd+Alt+4, then arrow down to &quot;Show Images&quot; Figure: IE WAT toolbar with 'Images' drop down and 'Show Images' highlighted. If there are any images missing alt, a dialog box appears with the number of images without alt attributes. The alt text will be displayed before the images in quotes on a light background. To check for missing alt: Look for the text &quot;NoAlt!&quot; (visually, or with find-in-page). If you find it, that means the following image is missing alt. To check if alt text is appropriate: For each image, see if the alt text adequately conveys the information in the image it is next to, per the Tips above. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} To check alt text with WebDev toolbar {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Open the web page you are checking. In the toolbar, select &quot;Images&quot;, then &quot;Outline Images&quot;, then &quot;Outline Images Without Alt Attributes&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Alt+T, W (to Web Developer Extension), I, O, A Red boxes appear around any images missing alt. Figure: WebDev toolbar menu, and red boxes around images. Note images without any alt text. In the toolbar, select &quot;Images&quot;, then &quot;Display Alt Attributes&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Alt+T, W (to Web Developer Extension), I, A The alt text will be displayed before the images as white letters on a red background. Figure: WebDev toolbar menu, and alt text displayed. For each image, see if the alt text adequately conveys the information in the image it is next to, per the Tips above. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} To check alt text with any browser {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Open WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool web page. Type the website address in the box after &quot;Enter the URL of the web site you want to evaluate:&quot; Click the &quot;WAVE this page!&quot; button. Your web page will show up in the browser with lots of little icons on it. To check for missing alt: Look for the red alt icon (), or search for the alt text &quot;ERROR: Missing alt text&quot;. If you find it, that means the following image is missing alt. To check if alt text is appropriate: Look for the green alt icon (). Next to it is text on a light blue background; the alt text is in between the asterisks (*). See if that text adequately conveys the information in the image it is next to, per the Tips above. Figure: WAVE showing alt text. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} To practice checking alt text in BAD {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} With one of the checks above, use the inaccessible home page www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/before/home Notice: Missing alt: There are lots of images without alt text. (Many of these are just decorative and should have null alt text, per the Tips above.) The weather image of the cloud and sun is missing alt. Inappropriate alt text: Near the top, left, see the long alt text starting with &quot;Red dot with...&quot;. That description is way too detailed and includes unimportant information. The appropriate alt text in the accessible page is: &quot;Citylights: your access to the city.&quot; Near the bottom in the middle, see the image of text: &quot;(1)269C-H-O-K-E&quot;. The alt is 123456789, which is not equivalent.

To make these work for everyone, the headings need to be marked up. That way people can navigate to the headings — including people who cannot use a mouse and use only the keyboard, and people who use a screen reader. Heading levels should have a meaningful hierarchy, e.g.: Heading Level 1 &lt;h1&gt; Heading Level 2 &lt;h2&gt; Heading Level 3 &lt;h3&gt; Heading Level 3 &lt;h3&gt; Heading Level 2 &lt;h2&gt; Heading Level 3 &lt;h3&gt; Heading Level 4 &lt;h4&gt; Heading Level 4 &lt;h4&gt; Heading Level 2 &lt;h2&gt; What to check for: The page has a heading. In almost all pages there should be at least one heading. All text that looks like a heading is marked up as a heading. All text that is marked up as a heading is really a conceptual section heading. The heading hierarchy is meaningful. Ideally the page starts with an &quot;h1&quot; — which is usually similar to the page title — and does not skip levels; however, these are not absolute requirements. Headings checks The checks below provide instructions with different browsers for how to get an outline from headings or headings markup in a page. Headings outline: an outline of the headings that are marked up on page, for example: Figure: Outline of headings. Headings markup in page: a view of the page with the heading markup shown, for example: Figure: Heading markup in page. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} To check headings with WebDev toolbar {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Headings outline: Open the web page you are checking.

Figure: Gray text on light background. High contrast (for example, dark text on light background or bright text on dark background) is required by some people with visual impairments, including many older people who lose contrast sensitivity from ageing. Figure: Dark text on light background, and yellow text on black background. While some people need high contrast, for others &mdash; including some people with reading disabilities such as dyslexia &mdash; bright colors (high luminance) are not readable. They need low luminance. Figure: Brown text on dark background, and dark text on medium brown background. Web browsers should allow people to change the color of text and background, and web pages need to work when people change colors. (This accessibility requirement is sometimes called sufficient &quot;color contrast&quot;; however, that is incorrect &mdash; technically it's &quot;luminance contrast&quot;. On this page we use &quot;contrast ratio&quot; as short for &quot;luminance contrast ratio&quot; because it's less jargony.) There is much more to know about contrast; we&#39;ve just introduced the basics here. What to check for: Web pages should also have a minimum contrast by default: a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal-size text. There are basically three ways to check contrast, each with strengths and weaknesses. Table with contrast ratio - The tool displays a table with all the possible contrast ratios in the web page. With some tools, you can click in the table and it will show where that color combination is in the web page. Pro: Comprehensive. Con: Can be inaccurate, specifically, it can show some color combinations that are not really in the displayed page. Eye-dropper to select colors - The tool lets you select a text color and a background color, then it shows you the contrast ratio. Pro: Accurate. Con: Can only test one item at a time. Need to be able to see and use a mouse. Turn off color. The tool shows the page in grayscale. Pro: Gives you direct experience. Con: Imprecise, does not provide contrast ratio value. Contrast checks Below are instructions for checking contrast with IE WAT; a list of other contrast analyzer tools is in the Related Resources section of Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} To check contrast with IE WAT {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Here's how to do the three checks for sufficient contrast described above. Table with contrast ratio: In the toolbar, select Color &gt; Juicy Studio Luminosity Analyser. Or, with the keyboard: Ctrl/cmd+Alt+5, then down arrow to &quot;Juicy Studio Luminosity Analyser&quot;. A new window opens titled Colour Contrast Analyser with the table of results. The last column is Luminosity Contrast Ratio. Eye-dropper to select colors: In the toolbar, select: Color &gt; Contrast Analyser [application]. Or, with the keyboard: Ctrl+Alt+5, then down arrow to &quot;Contrast Analyser [application]&quot;. The Color Contrast Analyser application window opens. Using the first eye-dropper icon from the foreground color section, pick the foreground color (usually the text) you want to analyze. Using the second eye-dropper icon from the background color section, pick the corresponding background color. In the bottom of the Color Contrast Analyser window, the resulting luminosity Contrast ratio will show (for example: 7.5:1), along with &quot;Pass&quot; or &quot;Fail&quot; and a visual example of the colors.

Some need to change other aspects of text display: font, space between lines, and more. Most browsers allow users to change text size through: text size settings (usually through Options or Preferences) text-only zoom page zoom (which also zooms images, buttons, etc.) When pages are not designed properly, they can be unusable when the text size is changed, especially when it is changed through text-only zoom or text settings. Sometimes columns and sections overlap, the space between lines disappears, lines of text become too long, or text disappears. Figure: Two screen captures show that when text size is increased, the heading overlaps the main text, the main text overlaps the sidebar text; and the sidebar text is cut off at the bottom. When text size is increased, sometimes part of the sentences are not visible and users have to scroll horizontally to read a sentence, as shown in the third example below. Most people cannot effectively read text that requires horizontal scrolling, and some disabilities make this impossible. Figure: The first image shows normal-size text. In the second image, the larger text &quot;wraps&quot; to fit the width. In the third image, some of the larger text is not visible without scrolling horizontally. What to do: Increase the text size. What to check for: All text gets larger. (A common problem is that text is not provided as actual text format but instead the text is in an image. Text in images does not get larger when users increase text size.) Text doesn't disappear or get cut off. Text, images, and other content do not overlap. All buttons, form fields, and other controls are visible and usable. Horizontal scrolling is not required to read sentences or &quot;blocks of text&quot;. It is best practice that when text size is increased, all the text in a sentence is visible. It is acceptable to have to scroll horizontally to get to different sections of a page. (For top-to-bottom languages, change &quot;horizontal scrolling&quot; to &quot;vertical scrolling&quot;.) Resize text checks The instructions below are for text-only zoom. You can also change the text size settings, for example, through Tools &gt; Options or Preferences. To keep this simple, we don't include instructions for changing those settings. We also don't include instructions for page zoom because it does not usually reveal the accessibility barriers described above. For Chrome, you need an extention to get text-only zoom. Instructions for Firefox, Safari, and IE are below. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} To check text-only zoom in Firefox {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Set zoom to text only.

People who are blind and some sighted people with mobility impairments rely on the keyboard or on assistive technologies and strategies that rely on keyboard commands, such as voice input. Accessible websites enable people to access all content and functionality &mdash; links, forms, media controls, etc. &mdash; through a keyboard. Keyboard focus should be visible and should follow a logical order through the page elements. Visible keyboard focus could be a border or highlight, as shown below, that moves as you tab through the web page. Figure: Dotted border on middle link. Figure: Name field is highlighted red. What to do: In a browser that supports keyboard navigation with the Tab key (for example, Firefox, IE, Chrome, and Safari; not Opera): In Mac browsers, enable keyboard navigation to all controls. In newer browsers: Select System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts. Select the &quot;All controls&quot; option button. In older browsers: Select System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts. In the &quot;Full Keyboard Access&quot; section, check &quot;All Controls&quot;. Click in the address bar, then put your mouse aside and do not use it. Press the 'Tab' key to move through the elements on the page. You can press 'Shift-Tab' to go backwards. To move within elements such as drop-down lists and menu bars, press the arrow keys. To select a specific item within a drop-down list: Tab to the list box, use the arrow keys to move the focus to items, when an item has focus, press the Enter key or Space bar to select that item. What to check for: Tab to all: Check that you can tab to all the elements, including links, form fields, buttons, and media player controls. (A common problem is that you cannot tab to media player controls.) Tab away: Check that you can tab away from all elements that you can tab into. (A common problem is the keyboard focus gets caught in media controls and you cannot get out; it's called the &quot;keyboard trap&quot;.) Tab order: Check that the tab order follows the logical reading order (e.g., for left-to-right languages: top to bottom, left to right) in sequence. Visual focus: Check that the focus is clearly visible as you tab through the elements, that is, you can tell which element has focus, e.g., links have a gray outline around them or are highlighted. All functionality by keyboard: Check that you can do everything with the keyboard; that is, you don't need the mouse to activate actions, options, visible changes, and other functionality. (A common problem is that some functionality is available only with mouse hover, and is not available with keyboard focus.) Drop-down lists: Check that after you tab into a drop-down list, you can use the arrow keys to move through all the options without triggering an action. (A common problem for drop-downs used for navigation is that as soon as you arrow down, it automatically selects the first item in the list and goes to a new page &mdash; you cannot get to other items in the list.) Image links: Check that when images are links, they have clear visual focus and can be activated using the keyboard (usually by pressing the Enter key). {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} To see visual focus with BAD {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Open the accessible Survey page: www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/after/survey Tab through the page.

If it's too complicated, consider skipping it for now and proceeding through the remaining checks. Labels, keyboard access, clear instructions, and effective error handling are important for forms accessibility. Form fields and other form controls usually have visible labels, such as &quot;E-mail Address:&quot; as the label for a text field. When these labels are marked up correctly, people can interact with them using only the keyboard, using voice input, and using screen readers. Also, the label itself becomes clickable, increasing the target area and making it easier to select small radio buttons or checkboxes. What to do: Find any forms on the page. A form could be a single text box, such as Search, or could be a complex form with text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, drop-down lists, and buttons. What to check for: Keyboard access Check that all form controls are keyboard accessible by following the keyboard access checks above, including checking that you can get to all items in any drop-down lists. Labels Check that every form control has a label associated with it using 'label', 'for', and 'id', as shown in the labels checks below. (This is best practice in most cases, though not a requirement because a form control label can be associated in other ways.) Check that the labels are positioned correctly. For left-to-right languages, labels should usually be: Left of text boxes and drop-down lists. Right of radio buttons and checkboxes. Required fields and other instructions Check that any fields that are required/mandatory are clearly indicated. Check that the indicator does not rely on color alone, for example, if required fields were only indicated by red colored labels, they would not be accessible to people who do not see the different colors. Check that the indicator (such as asterisks (*)) is included in the marked up field label for text boxes and drop-down lists, or legend for radio buttons and checkboxes, as shown in the labels checks below. Check that any instructions for completing the form are before they are needed, for example, General instructions should usually be at the top of the form or the section they relate to. Check that required formats, such as dates (year-month-date in the format 0000-00-00), are included in the marked up label, using the labels checks below. Error handling Some simple forms, such as a single search field, might not have any errors. If you think the form(s) on the page you are checking might have error messages, try leaving required fields blank or entering incorrectly-formatted information (such as telephone number or e-mail address), then submitting the form. If you get errors: Check that clear and specific guidance is provided to help people understand and fix the error. If the error concerns a format such as date, time, or address, check that the correct format is clearly explained. Check that the errors are easily findable. Generally it is best if the error messages are before the form, rather than after the form. Check that the fields without errors are still populated with the data you entered. (This is best practice, though not a requirement.) People should not have to re-enter all the information in the form, except for some sensitive data such as credit card numbers. Labels checks Note: These instructions help you check if labels are marked up with 'label', 'for', and 'id'; they do not check if form controls are identified in other ways. Therefore, even if a form does not pass these checks, it might still meet WCAG. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} To check labels with IE WAT {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Open the web page you are checking. In the toolbar, select &quot;Structure&quot;, then &quot;FieldSet / Labels&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Ctrl+Alt+6, then down arrow key to &quot;FieldSet / Labels&quot;, and select. A dialog box appears with the number of errors and controls. Figure: IE WAT dialog box. The dialog box tells you the number of identified errors, the total number of form controls, and the number of controls that you need to check manually. For the rest of the steps you need to look at the text around the labels. If this is difficult, you could skip the next steps. The form elements (labels and controls) are outlined in a red box, the markup is shown, and potential errors are indicated. Example with no errors: Figure: Form markup shown. Date label includes format. Example with potential errors: Figure: Form markup shown. Date label does not include format. Fieldset missing legend. Check that every field label has label for=&quot;x&quot; before it and id=&quot;x&quot; in the box with it, and that the text in quotes matches. (&quot;x&quot; can be anything; for example, for=&quot;park&quot;, id=&quot;park&quot;) If the label is missing, it will indicate &quot;Label no for&quot;. If the for and id do not match, it will indicate &quot;input No Match id=&quot;x&quot; Error&quot;. Check that the required field indicator is in the field label, or for radio button and check boxes, it is in the &quot;legend&quot;. For example: Correct: The asterisk (*) is included in the box around the label. Incorrect: The asterisk (*) is outside of the box around the label. Correct: &quot;(required)&quot; is in the legend. Incorrect: &quot;(required)&quot; is not in the legend. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} Checking labels with other browsers {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} There is not an easy way to check form control labels with the WebDev toolbar.

To check labels if you're comfortable looking at the HTML markup Open the source HTML and find the form markup. Check that: Each form control has a label element with a for attribute that matches the value of the id attribute in the related control. For example: &lt;label for=&quot;firstname&quot;&gt;First name: &lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;firstname&quot; id=&quot;firstname&quot; /&gt; Each id is unique within the web page. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} To practice checking form labels and errors with BAD {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Labels: Open the Accessible Survey Page: www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/after/survey that has several forms.

Users need to be able to control moving content, especially some people with attention deficit disorder or visual processing disorders. Potential accessibility problems with moving, flashing, or blinking content include: Understanding moving information — Some people read and process information slowly. The content may disappear before people have time to read it. Some people have difficulty tracking moving objects. Distraction from moving content — Moving content can make focusing and reading elsewhere difficult; that is, people cannot focus on some content because the movement in another area of the web page grabs their attention. Additionally, flashing or blinking content can cause seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy, particularly if it: flashes more than three times in one second, covers a large enough area of the screen, and is bright enough. What to check for: Check if there is any moving, blinking, or scrolling information that starts automatically and lasts more than five seconds. If there is, check that there is a way for the user to pause, stop, or hide the movement. Check if there is any auto-updated information (such as stock price). If there is, check that there is a way for the user to pause, stop, or hide the updated information, or for the user to control the frequency of the update. Check that no content flashes or blinks more than three times in one second.

Visual information in videos is not available to people who are blind or some people what have low vision, unless it is provided in an alternative format such as audio or text. (Text can be read by a screen reader or Braille display, or enlarged and reformatted for people with low vision.) (Remember these easy checks are not comprehensive or definitive.) What to check for: Keyboard access Follow the steps above for keyboard access to ensure that the media player controls are labeled and keyboard accessible. Auto-start control It is best if audio (including background noise and video with sound) does not start automatically when a web page opens. If it does start automatically, it should either: Stop after 3 seconds. Include controls to pause or stop the audio. Include controls to turn down the volume. Captions (Captions are known as &quot;subtitles&quot; in some areas.) Most video on the web that provides captions has &quot;closed captions&quot; that can be turned on and off. (&quot;Open captions&quot; are always shown.) For example, in YouTube, you turn on captions with the CC button (no known keyboard access). If there is not a CC button, there are no captions available for that video. Automatic captions are not sufficient for accessibility because they are not accurate enough. For example, in YouTube, if only &quot;automatic captions&quot; are listed, there are no sufficient captions and the video is not accessible. Captions in the specific language need to be listed. Figure: Captions listed: French (automatic captions), Norwegian. If there are captions, you can check that: The captions seem in sync with the spoken content. The people who are speaking are identified when they speak. Important sound other than dialogue &mdash; e.g., footsteps approaching, doors closing, glass breaking &mdash; is included. Transcript It is best practice to provide both captions and transcripts, although not always required; providing transcripts has many benefits &mdash; both to people with disabilities and to website owners. Transcripts should be easy to find near the audio/video itself and any links to the audio/video. Check that transcripts include all audio information, including dialogue with the speakers identified, and all important sound &mdash; e.g., footsteps approaching, doors closing, glass breaking. A transcript for a video could provide all the audio and all the visual information, so that a person can get all the content of the video by reading the text. Audio description Audio description (sometimes known as described video, video description, or visual interpretation) is description of important visual information in a video, in order to make it accessible to people who cannot see. For example, some videos start out with a title in text, have speaker names in text, and have illustrations. That visual information needs to be provided to people who cannot see the video. It can be provided through: Audio description - where the audio track includes someone describing the important visuals. Audio description can be included in the main video, or it can be provided in a separate video. Text transcript - that includes description of meaningful visual information (so it's kind of like a screenplay). {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} Learn more about multimedia alternatives {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} W3C Multimedia Accessibility FAQ Captions - Understanding Success Criterion 1.2.2 for WCAG (Level A) Audio Description or Media Alternative - Understanding Success Criterion 1.2.3 for WCAG (Level A) Audio Control - Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.2 for WCAG (Level A) Media Alternative - Understanding Success Criterion 1.2.8 for WCAG (Level AAA) {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} Basic structure check While the other checks on this page focus on specific success criteria in WCAG, this check is more broad. It helps you understand how some people &quot;see&quot; the web page differently. For this basic structure check, you look at the web page without images, styles, and layout. Web pages are often designed with multiple columns, sections, colors, and other visual aspects that help organize information for people who see the page in its default display. However, some people do not see the page this way. People who are blind listen to the page with a screen reader or read it from a Braille display. Some people with low vision and others change the way the page is displayed so they can read it; for example, change from multiple columns to one column, change the text size, and more. An important issue is how the web page works when it is &quot;linearized&quot; into one column and the presentation is changed, as shown in the images below. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" %} Images showing linearized and changed display (click to show images) {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} The images below illustrate how a web page is displayed in 3 columns by default and how it can be changed. Figure A shows the default display of three columns, with the navigation at the left. Figure A. Figure B shows the page linearized into one column, with the navigation at the top. Figure C shows the page linearized, with the navigation at the bottom. The order of the sections (e.g., navigation at top or bottom or elsewhere) depends on how the web page is developed &mdash; the user usually cannot control the order. Figure B. Figure C. Figure D shows the page linearized and with styles turned off. When you follow the Basic structure checks steps below, your page will look like something like this: Figure D. Figure E shows the page changed by a person with low vision to make it more readable, for example, the main text is big, the footer text is very small, and the headings are a different color. Figure E. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} While it is useful to have an experienced screen reader user check web pages, anyone can get an initial idea of potential accessibility barriers for screen reader users and others who change the way the page is presented. The steps below show you how to disable images, disable styles for how the page is usually displayed, and linearize the page to check the page structure. Notes: Data tables will not make sense when linearized &mdash; that's OK because screen readers have functionality to make data tables usable (when they are marked up correctly). BAD provides a clear example of how the basic structure check reveals accessibility barriers. (It's also a bit funny, and we suggest you check it out, by following the BAD instructions below.) What to do: Get a basic structure view of the page by following the instructions under Basic structure checks below to: Turn off images and show the text alternatives. Turn off style sheets (CSS), which specifies how the page is displayed with layout, colors, etc. Linearize the page or the tables (depending on the toolbar). What to check for: Check that the information makes sense when read in the order it is shown; for example, headings are right above the information they apply to. (Data tables do not need to make sense linearized, per the note above.) Check that the alternative text provides adequate information for the missing images (per the Image text alternatives section above). Check that blocks of information have clear headings (see also the Headings section above). When navigation, main content, and other sections have good headings, it's easier for people to find their way around the information.

As web technology broadens in scope and reach, and understanding of users' needs increases through research and experience, the set of accessibility considerations for websites becomes larger. Rather than developing complex solutions for a wide range of users, designing sites in a way that they can be personalized to the needs of each user provides more optimal accessibility. Personalization enables users to use adaptive widgets and user preferences to customize their user experience. It enables content authors to provide a default design and enable user personalization with minimal work. ### Examples of Personalization to Meet User Needs {#examples} * Some people are easily **distracted or overwhelmed by lots of information** on a website. They have difficulty finding and focusing on key information. Personalization allows users to hide extraneous information so they only get what they need to understand and use the main content. * Some people have **difficulty understanding numbers** (\"dyscalculia\"). Personalization allows users to change numeric information. For example, a temperature of 32&deg;F/0&deg;C is replaced with a picture of a person wearing a hat, scarf, and mittens, and the text \"very cold\". * Some people with severe language impairment **cannot read text**. They use symbols to represent words. Personalization allows users to change text to symbols. ## Who the Personalization Documents are for * **Content developers** can add syntax to support personalization. * **User agents** such as browser extensions and assistive technology can use the syntax to manipulate the content to meet the user’s need. User agents can also use user preferences for different interface options. ## The Personalization Documents * [Requirements for Personalization Semantics](https://www.w3.org/TR/personalization-semantics-requirements-1.0/) (Working Draft Note) includes user stories, specific use cases, and requirements for personalization. * [Personalization Semantics Explainer](https://www.w3.org/TR/personalization-semantics-1.0/) (Working Draft Note) is the core introductory document that explains general use cases, vocabulary, and anticipated uses. * [Personalization Semantics Content Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/personalization-semantics-content-1.0/) (Working Draft specification) is the technical specification that provides terms authors can use to enhance web content with information about controls, symbols, and user interface elements. * [Personalization Help and Support](https://www.w3.org/TR/personalization-semantics-help-1.0/) (Working Draft) lists examples of the personalized help and support properties. * [Personalization Tools](https://www.w3.org/TR/personalization-semantics-tools-1.0/) (Working Draft) lists examples of the personalized tools properties. ## Who Develops the Personalization Documents Personalization documents are developed by the [Personalization Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/task-forces/personalization/) of the Accessible Platform Working Group ([APA WG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/)), which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org/)) Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/)).

    "title": "Essential Components of Web Accessibility",
    "text": "{::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"2\" title=\"Summary\" class=\"full\" %} {:/} This page shows how web accessibility depends on several components working together, and how improvements in specific components could substantially improve web accessibility. It provides the foundation for understanding the different accessibility standards developed by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"start\" title=\"Page Contents\" class=\"simple\" %} {:/} {::options toc_levels=\"2\" /} - This text will be replaced by the TOC. {:toc} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Introduction {#intro} {:.no_toc} It is essential that several different components of web development and interaction work together in order for the web to be accessible to people with disabilities. These components include: - **content** - the information in a web page or web application, including: - natural information such as text, images, and sounds - code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc. - **web browsers, media players**, and other \"user agents\" - **assistive technology**, in some cases - screen readers, alternative keyboards, switches, scanning software, etc. - **users**' knowledge, experiences, and in some cases, adaptive strategies using the web - **developers** - designers, coders, authors, etc., including developers with disabilities and users who contribute content - **authoring tools** - software that creates websites - **evaluation tools** - web accessibility evaluation tools, HTML validators, CSS validators, etc. ## How the Components Relate {#relate} {% assign example_url = \"/fundamentals/components/examples/#relate\" | relative_url %} ![illustration showing how components relate, detailed description at {{ example_url }}]({{ \"/content-images/wai-components/relate.png\" | relative_url }}){:longdesc=\"{{example_url}}\"} Web **developers** usually use **authoring tools** and evaluation tools to create web **content**. **People** (\"**users**\") use web **browsers, media players, assistive technologies,** or other \"**user agents**\" to get and interact with the **content**. ## Interdependencies Between Components {#depend} There are significant interdependencies between the components; that is, the components must work together in order for the web to be accessible. For example, for alternative text on images: - **technical specifications** address alternative text (for example, HTML defines the alternative text attribute (`alt`) of the image element (`img`)) - **WAI guidelines** ([WCAG, ATAG, UAAG described below](#guidelines)) - define how to implement alternative text for accessibility in the different components - **developers** provide the appropriate alternative text wording - **authoring tools** enable, facilitate, and promote providing alternative text in a web page - **evaluation tools** are used to help check that alternative text exists - **user agents** provide human and machine interface to the alternative text - **assistive technologies** provide human interface to the alternative text in various modalities - **users** know how to get the alternative text from their user agent and/or assistive technology as needed ### The Implementation Cycle When accessibility features are effectively implemented in one component, the other components are more likely to implement them. {% assign example_url = \"/fundamentals/components/examples/#cycle\" | relative_url %} ![illustration of implementation cycle, detailed description at {{ example_url }}]({{ \"/content-images/wai-components/cycle.png\" | relative_url }}){:longdesc=\"{{example_url}}\"} - When **web browsers, media players, assistive technologies, and other user agents** support an accessibility feature, users are more likely to demand it and developers are more likely to implement it in their **content**. - When developers want to implement an accessibility feature in their **content**, they are more likely to demand that their **authoring tool** make it easy to implement. - When **authoring tools** make a feature easy to implement, developers are more likely to implement it in their **content**. - When an accessibility feature is implemented in **most content**, developers and users are more likely to demand that **user agents** support it. ### When One Component is Weak If an accessibility feature is not implemented in one component, there is little motivation for the other components to implement it when it does not result in an accessible user experience. For example, developers are unlikely to implement an accessibility feature that authoring tools do not support and that most browsers or assistive technologies do not implement consistently. {% assign example_url = \"/fundamentals/components/examples/#weak\" | relative_url %} ![illustration of what happens when one component is weak, detailed description at {{ example_url }}]({{ \"/content-images/wai-components/bridge.png\" | relative_url }}){:longdesc=\"{{example_url}}\"} If one component has poor accessibility support, sometimes other components can compensate through \"work-arounds\" that require much more effort and are not good for accessibility overall. For example, - developers can do more work to compensate for some lack of accessibility support in authoring tools; for example, coding markup directly instead of through a tool - users can do more work to compensate for some lack of accessibility support in browsers, media players, and assistive technology and lack of accessibility of content; for example, using different browsers or assistive technologies to overcome different accessibility issues However, in most cases the works-arounds are not implemented and the result is still poor accessibility. Additionally, sometimes poor accessibility support in one component cannot be reasonably overcome by other components and the result is inaccessibility, making it impossible for some people with disabilities to use a particular website, page, or feature. ## Guidelines and Other Standards {#guidelines} The World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/)) Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)) develops **web accessibility standards** for the different components: - [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/atag/\" | relative_url }}) addresses authoring tools - [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}) addresses web content, and is used by developers, authoring tools, and accessibility evaluation tools - [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/uaag/\" | relative_url }}) addresses web browsers and media players, including some aspects of assistive technologies These accessibility guidelines are based on the fundamental technical specifications of the web, and are developed in coordination with all W3C technical specifications (HTML, CSS, SVG, SMIL, etc.). W3C also develops technical specifications that directly address accessibility, including: * [ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/aria/\" | relative_url }}) Suite, which defines a way to make web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. It especially helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. {% assign example_url = \"/fundamentals/components/examples/#guide\" | relative_url %} ![illustration showing the guidelines for the different components, detailed description at {{ example_url }}]({{ \"/content-images/wai-components/specs.png\" | relative_url }}){:longdesc=\"{{example_url}}\"} For more information, see [W3C Accessibility Standards Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/\" | relative_url }}).",

Unfortunately many approach accessibility just as a checklist. This risks missing the real purpose of accessibility - the user experience. A checklist replaces the person. The website on the screen crumbles. 4 people replace the computer and checklist. Involving people with disabilities throughout your design and development process can be more effective and yield better results: designers and developers learn how people with disabilities use the web, and understand assistive technologies and adaptive strategies they use; The group of people are surrounded by icons inserted in a development process cycle: pen icon; coding icon; paintbrush icon; and a magnifying glass icon.

Involving Users in Web Accessibility, W3C and Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) logos. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} ## Introduction {#intro} Web accessibility evaluation often focuses on [conformance to accessibility standards]({{ \"/test-evaluate/conformance/\" | relative_url }}) such as [WCAG]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}). While conformance is important, there are many [benefits to evaluating with real people]({{ \"/planning/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}#why). For example, to learn how your website or web tool really works for users and to better understand accessibility issues. Evaluating with users with disabilities and with older users identifies usability issues that are not discovered by conformance evaluation alone. This page is part of a multi-page [Evaluating Web Accessibility resource suite]({{ \"/test-evaluate/\" | relative_url }}) that outlines different aspects of evaluating web accessibility. It is the second of two pages on including users in web projects. **Please read [Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility]({{ \"/planning/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}), which covers broader issues of including users *early* in website design, tool development, standards, and other web projects.** ## Initial Review {#prelim} A first step in evaluating web accessibility is reviewing the website to check for any obvious accessibility problems. For example, some checks are in [Easy Checks – A First Review of Web Accessibility]({{ \"/test-evaluate/preliminary/\" | relative_url }}). Even web developers with little accessibility knowledge can find some accessibility issues through an initial review. An accessibility expert with first-hand experience of how people with different disabilities interact with the web can: - evaluate accessibility issues for a broad range of users, which might not be found by individual users - help fix any known barriers before bringing in users - focus the evaluation with users on potential areas of concern **The initial review identifies any significant accessibility barriers to fix before evaluating with users. It also helps define what to focus on for evaluation with users.** ## Range of User Evaluation {#range} Users with disabilities and older users can be included in a wide range of evaluation activities, from brief consultations to large-scale usability studies. **There are many options in between these extremes**: - **Informal evaluations** of specific accessibility issues can be very simple. For example, ask someone you know who uses a screen reader or someone with other disabilities to find some data in an early draft of a data table. Observe their interaction and discuss the issues. - **Formal usability testing** of a website follows established protocols to gather quantitative and qualitative data from representative users performing specific tasks. [Formal usability tests can be optimized](#ut-access) to focus on accessibility issues. What type of evaluation you do depends on factors such as the stage in your project, for example, initial investigation of design ideas, testing specific areas of prototypes, or reviewing final designs. **Conducting informal evaluations throughout development is more effective than only formal usability testing at the end of a project.** ## Basics {#basics} In most cases, including users in evaluation involves: - getting a few people with disabilities - and depending on your target audience, older users - including them throughout the development process to complete sample tasks on prototypes so you can see how the different aspects of the design and coding could be improved - discussing accessibility issues with them **See [Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility]({{ \"/planning/involving-users/\" | relative_url }})** for guidance on [getting a range of users](/WAI/users/involving#diverse) and [users' experience interacting with the web](/WAI/users/involving#experience) Just as with any evaluation with users, whether you include novice, average, or advanced users depends on your target users. For example, if you are developing a web application for accountants inside a company, you probably want advanced assistive technology users. And for a public website to apply for disability benefits, you want novice assistive technology users. Caution: Carefully consider all input. Avoid assuming that input from one person with a disability applies to all people with disabilities. A person with a disability does not necessarily know how other people with the same disability interact with the web. They might not know enough about other disabilities to provide valid guidance on other accessibility issues. Getting input from a range of users is best. Note: In addition to finding accessibility problems, evaluating with users with disabilities usually reveals general usability problems that impact all users, including those *without* disabilities. ## Analyzing Accessibility Issues {#analyz} Web accessibility depends on several [components of web development and interaction working together]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}), including web browsers, assistive technologies (AT), and web content. Accessibility problems can be caused by one or more different components. For example, if a user who cannot use a mouse has trouble with keyboard access, it could be because: - the developer did not markup/code the web page properly, or - the browser or media player isn't handling the markup properly, or - the user's AT isn't handling the markup properly, or - the user doesn't know how to use the browser, media player, or AT's keyboard access features, or - the page is poorly designed and it is a general usability problem for all users, including those *without* disabilities ## Combine User Evaluation with Standards {#stdstoo} Involving users with disabilities in evaluation has many benefits. Yet that alone cannot determine if a website is accessible. Combine user involvement with [evaluating conformance to WCAG]({{ \"/test-evaluate/conformance/\" | relative_url }}) to ensure that accessibility is provided to users with a range of disabilities and situations. ## Drawing Conclusions and Reporting {#drawing} Be careful drawing conclusions from limited evaluations or studies. Results from only a couple of people with disabilities cannot be generalized to apply to all people with similar disabilities or people with other disabilities. See the [Caution](#caution) above. Include in the reports the scope of the study and the evaluation parameters, such as testing methods and user characteristics. For example, if a study included only participants who are blind, the report should clarify that it did not evaluate conformance to accessibility standards and that it does not apply to all people with disabilities. While small studies often provide useful information, they are not robust enough to provide statistical significance. ## Note for usability professionals {#ut-access} When specifically exploring accessibility barriers, the protocol is usually different from a general usability test. For example: - you would likely use a think-aloud technique with high facilitator interaction - data collection would focus on understanding errors related to accessibility barriers, rather than on time-on-task or user satisfaction - tasks would concentrate on specific areas of concern for potential accessibility problems, rather than general site usage Note that it is also important to evaluate other factors for users with disabilities. These factors include: General usability, user satisfaction, and other similar criteria. The More Information section below includes additional guidance specifically for usability professionals. ## More Information and Guidance {#fmi} This document briefly addresses a few points of a very complex topic. Many resources on other aspects of involving users in evaluation are available on the Web. - **[Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility]({{ \"/planning/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}) is a prerequisite for this document**. It covers broader issues of including users early in website design, tool development, standards, and other web projects. - [Just Ask: Integrating Accessibility Throughout Design](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/overview.html) provides guidance on incorporating accessibility throughout design of websites and other products. The chapter on [Usability Testing for Accessibility](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/ut.html) includes: - Planning for usability testing for accessibility – [determining participant characteristics](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/ut_plan.html#characteristics), [recruiting participants](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/ut_plan.html#recruiting), providing compensation - Preparing for usability testing for accessibility – preparing test materials, ensuring the facility is accessible, setting up and testing the assistive technology, conducting a pilot test, using [screening techniques](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/screening.html) - Conducting a usability test for accessibility – [interacting with people with disabilities](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/ut_conduct.html#interacting), setting up the room - [Reporting usability testing for accessibility](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/ut_report.html) – distinguishing between accessibility and usability issues, drawing conclusions, writing about people with disabilities - [White paper: conducting user evaluations with people with disabilities](https://web.archive.org/web/20160603030517/http://www-03.ibm.com/able/resources/userevaluations.html) - Many books, articles, conference presentations, and other resources cover usability evaluation techniques. They include different types of usability testing; test design; developing test protocol including questionnaires, tasks, data collection; conducting pilot tests; and how many participants to include in usability testing. For example: [Usability Testing Demystified](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/usability-testing-demystified/), [sample test plans and forms from The Handbook of Usability Testing](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470185481,descCd-DOWNLOAD.html), and [Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and Fixing Usability Problems](http://www.sensible.com/rocketsurgery/index.html) with a sample usability test, scripts, and forms online. - There are organizations around the world that specialize in helping recruit people with disabilities and conduct evaluations with users with disabilities.",

You can use them through all phases of the web design and development process. Tools can provide fully-automated checks, and help you with manual review. We cannot check all accessibility aspects automatically. Human judgement is required. Sometimes evaluation tools can produce false or misleading results. Web accessibility evaluation tools can not *determine* accessibility, they can only *assist* in doing so. ## Features of Evaluation Tools {:#features} Web accessibility evaluation tools target different audiences. This includes designers, developers, non-technical content authors, quality assurance testers, and sometimes also end-users. Tools offer different features and functionality which may help users to compare and assess web accessibility evaluation tools for their specific needs. ### Main Features The following features describe tools found on the [Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools List](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/). These can be used as filters to reduce the number of tools shown. * **Guidelines** Different organizations and governments may require conformance with different accessibility standards, thus different tools support these standards. The W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is internationally recognized as the standard for web accessibility, and supported by most tools. * **Language** Evaluation tools support different languages. This includes the user interface of the tools, as well as the language of the content they support (for example, for detecting language-related barriers). * **Type of Tool** Evaluation tools can be plugins (extensions) for authoring tools and web browsers, command line tools, desktop or mobile applications, and online services. Different tools may be combined, depending on your design and development process. * **Supported Formats** Most evaluation tools check the accessibility of HTML content. Some check other web technologies, such as WAI-ARIA, CSS, SVG, and PDF. * **Assists by** Some web accessibility evaluation tools can be used in more than one way. The following are some common characteristics used to support the evaluation process: * *Reports* are useful to determine the conformance of the checkpoints that can be automatically checked. * *Step-by-step evaluations*: Wizard-based evaluation tools guide users through sequences of checks. They conduct automated checks and prompt the user to manually assess the rest. For example, a wizard-based tool may check images for alternate text. The user then evaluates how appropriate the alternate text is. * *In-page feedback*: This feature inserts temporary icons and markup to display results of accessibility checks. They are useful to view issues in context. They are also useful to understand the relative importance of each issue. * *Page transformation*: Transformation tools change the appearance of a site to help identify design issues. For example, the tool may show the site in text only or without color. These tools are useful to compensate for the limitations of automated testing. * **Automatically Checks** The scope of what the evaluation tool can automatically test varies depending on the tool. Some tools check a single page, while others check entire groups of related pages. Some can also access password-restricted content. * **License** Evaluation tools are available under a variety of license types, such as Open Source, Commercial, Enterprise, etc. * **Accessibility Information** It is important that evaluation tools are accessible so that people with disabilities can use them. Some tools provide information on how well they support accessibility. ### More Detailed Features The following features are other options available in evaluation tools. Some features listed are available in the [Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools List](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/) under Type of Tool. * **Authoring Tool Plugins** Such plugin tools often assist non-technical content authors to check the content they are creating directly within their authoring tools. These include MS Word, Adobe Acrobat, content management systems, as well as other tools. * **API** Some authoring and quality assurance tools can access some evaluation tools directly. The evaluation tools offer different types of APIs to allow this interaction. * **Browser Plugin** Such plugins may assist web designers, quality assurance testers, and evaluation experts to check content directly within the browser. * **Online Service** Evaluation tools provide different types of online services: * *Online checkers* often are websites where you can enter your own website's address to get it checked. Sometimes this may also be a web service accessed through an API by authoring or quality assurance tools. * *Hosted services* can regularly check your entire website and provide reports on improvements over time. They may also offer other solutions for enterprises. Usually these require subscription with the tool vendor. * *Server installation* of some evaluation tools provides an integrated way to check your entire website on your internal network. They can sometimes check password-restricted or draft content. * **Report Format** Many tools generate report formats such as HTML, CSV, PDF, XML, etc. ## Further Considerations {:#further} There are many considerations to take into account when selecting an evaluation tool. Each organization, project, and team has differing needs for different features. Web designers could be looking for tools to analyze their design's accessibility performance. Web developers will prefer tools that help them assess their code. Web content authors have different requirements to help them complete their tasks. An organization may need a fully automated evaluation tool to track their whole website. Another organization may only need occasional spot checks. You may want to consider the following items when selecting an evaluation tool: ### Organizational Structure and Development Process Development teams may gain from using a combination of evaluation tools. Using a combination of tools could meet the various team members' needs during all stages of the project. ### Complexity and Size of the Web Content Some complex sites could have a lot of multimedia content. Other complex sites could use advanced technologies such as SMIL or MathML. Specialized evaluation tools may be critical for these websites. ### Skills and Knowledge of the Web Developers Select the tool commensurate to team's skills. Some evaluation tools require users to have more knowledge of accessibility or code. Some tools also help to increase accessibility or code knowledge.",

However, currently many sites and tools are developed with accessibility barriers that make them difficult or impossible for some people to use. Making the web accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society. International web standards define what is needed for accessibility. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::options toc_levels=\"2\" /} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"start\" title=\"Page Contents\" class=\"full\" %} {:/} - TOC is created automatically. {:toc} Related Resource {% include video-link.html title=\"Video Introduction to Web Accessibility and W3C Standards (4 minutes)\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/videos/standards-and-benefits.html\" src=\"/content-images/wai-intro-accessibility/video-still-accessibility-intro-16-9.jpg\" %} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Accessibility in Context {#context} The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect. Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability. Thus the impact of disability is radically changed on the Web because the Web removes barriers to communication and interaction that many people face in the physical world. However, when websites, applications, technologies, or tools are badly designed, they can create barriers that exclude people from using the Web. **Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high-quality websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products and services.** ## What is Web Accessibility {#what} Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can: - perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web - contribute to the Web Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including: - auditory - cognitive - neurological - physical - speech - visual Web accessibility also benefits people *without* disabilities, for example: - people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc. - older people with changing abilities due to ageing - people with \"temporary disabilities\" such as a broken arm or lost glasses - people with \"situational limitations\" such as in bright sunlight or in an environment where they cannot listen to audio - people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth For a 7-minute video with examples of how accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for everyone in a variety of situations, see: {% include video-link.html title=\"Web Accessibility Perspectives Video (YouTube)\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f31oufqFSM\" src=\"/content-images/wai-intro-accessibility/video-still-accessibility-perspectives-16-9.jpg\" %} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"3\" title=\"More Info on What is Accessibility\" class=\"simple aside\" %} {:/} - When you want to learn more about how different disabilities affect Web use, and read about scenarios of people with disabilities using the Web, see [How People with Disabilities Use the Web]({{ \"/people-use-web/\" | relative_url }}). - If you want more examples of benefits for others, with WCAG to support them, see [Shared Web Experiences: Barriers Common to Mobile Device Users and People with Disabilities]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/shared-experiences/\" | relative_url }}) and the archived [Web Accessibility Benefits People With and Without Disabilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/archive/soc#groups). {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Accessibility is Important for Individuals, Businesses, Society {#important} The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. It is essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities. Access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, is defined as a basic human right in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN [CRPD](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html)). The Web offers the possibility of unprecedented access to information and interaction for many people with disabilities. That is, the accessibility barriers to print, audio, and visual media can be much more easily overcome through web technologies. Accessibility supports social inclusion for people with disabilities as well as others, such as: - older people - people in rural areas - people in developing countries **There is also a strong business case for accessibility.** As shown in the previous section, accessible design improves overall user experience and satisfaction, especially in a variety of situations, across different devices, and for older users. Accessibility can enhance your brand, drive innovation, and extend your market reach. Web accessibility is **required by law** in many situations. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"3\" title=\"More Info on Accessibility is Important\" class=\"simple aside\" %} {:/} - General information on business benefits is in [The Business Case for Digital Accessibility]({{ \"/business-case/\" | relative_url }}). - Guidance on figuring out legal requirements is in the archived [Legal and Policy Factors](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/archive/pol). {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Making the Web Accessible {#making} Web accessibility depends on several components working together, including web technologies, web browsers and other \\\"user agents\\\", authoring tools, and websites. The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI]({{ \"/get-involved/\" | relative_url }})) develops technical specifications, guidelines, techniques, and supporting resources that describe accessibility solutions. These are considered international standards for web accessibility; for example, WCAG 2.0 is also an ISO standard: ISO/IEC 40500. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"3\" title=\"More Info on Making the Web Accessible\" class=\"simple aside\" %} {:/} - More about these aspects of accessibility working together is in [Essential Components of Web Accessibility]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}). - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG), ARIA for Accessible Rich Internet Applications, and other important resources are introduced in [W3C Accessibility Standards Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/\" | relative_url }}). - To learn more about how W3C WAI develops material through multi-stakeholder, international participation and how you can contribute, see [About W3C WAI]({{ \"/about/\" | relative_url }}) and [Participating in WAI]({{ \"/get-involved/\" | relative_url }}). {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ### Making Your Website Accessible {#website} Many aspects of accessibility are fairly easy to understand and implement. Some accessibility solutions are more complex and take more knowledge to implement. It is most efficient and effective to incorporate accessibility from the very beginning of projects, so you don't need go back and to re-do work. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"3\" title=\"More Info on Making Your Website Accessible\" class=\"simple aside\" %} {:/} - For an introduction to accessibility requirements and international standards, see [Accessibility Principles]({{ \"/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/\" | relative_url }}). - To understand some common accessibility barriers from the perspective of testing, see [Easy Checks – A First Review of Web Accessibility]({{ \"/test-evaluate/preliminary/\" | relative_url }}). - For some basic considerations on designing, writing, and developing for accessibility, see [Tips for Getting Started]({{ \"/tips/\" | relative_url }}). - When you're ready to know more about developing and designing, you'll probably use resources such as: - [How to Meet WCAG (Quick Reference)](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) - [Web Accessibility Tutorials](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/) - For project management and organizational considerations, see [Planning and Managing Web Accessibility]({{ \"/planning-and-managing/\" | relative_url }}). If you need to make quick fixes now, see [Web Accessibility First Aid: Approaches for Interim Repairs]({{ \"/planning/interim-repairs/\" | relative_url }}). {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Evaluating Accessibility {#evaluate} When developing or redesigning a website, evaluate accessibility early and throughout the development process to identify accessibility problems early, when it is easier to address them. Simple steps, such as changing settings in a browser, can help you evaluate some aspects of accessibility. Comprehensive evaluation to determine if a website meets all accessibility guidelines takes more effort. There are evaluation tools that help with evaluation. However, no tool alone can determine if a site meets accessibility guidelines. Knowledgeable human evaluation is required to determine if a site is accessible. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"3\" title=\"More Info on Evaluating Accessibility\" class=\"simple aside\" %} {:/} - Resources to help with accessibility evaluation are described in [Evaluating Web Accessibility Overview]({{ \"/test-evaluate/\" | relative_url }}). {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"examples\" %} ## Examples {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} ### Alternative Text for Images ![image of logo; HTML markup img alt='Web Accessibility Initiative logo'](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/alt-logo.png){:.right} Images should include *[equivalent alternative text](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv.html)* (alt text) in the markup/code. If alt text isn't provided for images, the image information is inaccessible, for example, to people who cannot see and use a screen reader that reads aloud the information on a page, including the alt text for the visual image. When equivalent alt text is provided, the information is available to people who are blind, as well as to people who turn off images (for example, in areas with expensive or low bandwidth). It's also available to technologies that cannot see images, such as search engines. ### Keyboard Input ![mouse crossed out](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/no-mouse.png){:.left width=\"67\" height=\"45\"} Some people cannot use a mouse, including many older users with limited fine motor control. An accessible website does not rely on the mouse; it makes [all functionality available from a keyboard](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation.html). Then people with disabilities can use [assistive technologies]({{ \"/planning/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}#at) that mimic the keyboard, such as speech input. ### Transcripts for Audio [![example transcript](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/transcript.png){:.right width=\"251\" height=\"254\"}](http://www.w3.org/WAI/highlights/200606wcag2interview.html) Just as images aren't available to people who can't see, audio files aren't available to people who can't hear. Providing a text transcript makes the audio information accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as to search engines and other technologies that can't hear. It's easy and relatively inexpensive for websites to provide transcripts. There are also [transcription services](http://www.uiaccess.com/transcripts/transcript_services.html) that create text transcripts in HTML format. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"3\" title=\"More Examples\" class=\"simple aside\" %} {:/} - [Tips for Getting Started]({{ \"/tips/\" | relative_url }}) - [Easy Checks – A First Review of Web Accessibility]({{ \"/test-evaluate/preliminary/\" | relative_url }}) - {% include video-link.html class=\"small inline\" title=\"Web Accessibility Perspectives &mdash; videos and descriptions\" href=\"/perspective-videos/\" src=\"/content-images/wai-intro-accessibility/video-still-accessibility-perspectives-16-9.jpg\" %} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} ## For More Information {#more-info} W3C WAI provides a wide range of resources on different aspects of web accessibility [standards]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/\" | relative_url }}), [education]({{ \"/teach-advocate/\" | relative_url }}), [testing/evaluation]({{ \"/test-evaluate/\" | relative_url }}), [project management, and policy]({{ \"/planning/\" | relative_url }}).

The WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Web \"content\" generally refers to the information in a web page or web application, including: - natural information such as text, images, and sounds - code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc. ## WCAG 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 {#versions} WCAG 2.0 was published on 11 December 2008. WCAG 2.1 was published on 5 June 2018. WCAG 2.2 is scheduled to be published in 2021. All requirements (\"success criteria\") from 2.0 are included in 2.1. The 2.0 success criteria are exactly the same (verbatim, word-for-word) in 2.1. All requirements in 2.0 and 2.1 will be included in 2.2. The wording of the 2.0 and 2.1 success criteria will be exactly the same in 2.2. There are additional success criteria in 2.1 that are not in 2.0. They are introduced in [What’s New in WCAG 2.1]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/\" | relative_url }}). The proposed new success criteria in 2.2 are introduced in [What's New in WCAG 2.2 Working Draft]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/\" | relative_url }}). **Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0**.And content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 will also conform to 2.1 and 2.0. (This is often called “backwards compatible”.) A website that meets WCAG 2.1 or 2.2 should meet the requirements of policies that reference WCAG 2.0. To put it another way: If you want to meet both WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1, you can use the 2.1 resources and you don't need to bother looking at 2.0. WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 are both existing standards. WCAG 2.1 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0. W3C encourages you to use the most recent version of WCAG when developing or updating content or accessibility policies. ## Who WCAG is for {#for} WCAG is primarily intended for: - Web content developers (page authors, site designers, etc.) - Web authoring tool developers - Web accessibility evaluation tool developers - Others who want or need a standard for web accessibility, including for mobile accessibility Related resources are intended to meet the needs of many different people, including policy makers, managers, researchers, and others. WCAG is a technical standard, not an introduction to accessibility. For introductory material, see [“Where should I start?” in the FAQ]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/faq/\" | relative_url }}#start). ## What is in the WCAG 2 Documents {#whatis2} **[WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)** and **[WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)** are stable, referenceable technical standards. They have 12-13 guidelines that are organized under [4 principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility). For each guideline, there are testable *success criteria*, which are at [three levels: A, AA, and AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#levels). For a short summary of the WCAG 2 guidelines, see **[WCAG 2.1 at a Glance]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/\" | relative_url }})**. To learn about web accessibility principles and guidelines, see **[Accessibility Principles]({{ \"/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/\" | relative_url }})**. The WCAG 2 supporting technical materials include: - [**How to Meet WCAG 2**: A customizable quick reference to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2 requirements (success criteria) and techniques](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) is essentially the [WCAG 2 checklist](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/). Most people use this quick references as the main resource for working with WCAG. - **Techniques for WCAG 2** ([2.1 Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/), [2.0 Techniques](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/)) gives you specific details on how to develop accessible web content, such as HTML code examples. The techniques are \"informative\", that is, you do not have to use them. The basis for determining conformance to WCAG 2 is the *success criteria* from the WCAG 2 standard, not the techniques. Read more in [Techniques in the FAQ]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/faq/\" | relative_url }}#techs). - **Understanding WCAG 2** ([2.1 Understanding](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/), [2.0 Understanding](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/)) has additional guidance on learning and implementing WCAG 2 for people who want to understand the guidelines and success criteria more thoroughly. For more details on how these documents are related and how they are linked, see **[WCAG 2 Documents]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/docs/\" | relative_url }})**. ### Translations Authorized Translations and unofficial translations of WCAG 2 are listed in [WCAG 2 Translations]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/translations/\" | relative_url }}). ### Technical document format The WCAG, Techniques, and Understanding documents follow the W3C format for technical reports, which has several sections at the beginning, including links to different versions, editors, abstract, and status. ### Supplemental guidance {#supplement} Supplemental guidance provides additional information beyond what is required in WCAG 2. \"Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities\" helps you increase accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. It is introduced in [Supplemental Guidance: Content Usable]({{ \"/cognitive/\" | relative_url }}#supplemental-guidance-content-usable). ## WCAG 2.0 is ISO/IEC 40500 {#iso} WCAG 2.0 is approved as an ISO standard: ISO/IEC 40500:2012. ISO/IEC 40500 is exactly the same as the original WCAG 2.0, which is introduced above along with supporting resources. The content of ISO/IEC 40500 is freely available from [www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/); it is available for purchase from the [ISO catalogue {% include_cached external.html %}](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=58625). Benefits of WCAG 2.0 as an ISO standard are summarized in [ISO in the FAQ]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/faq/\" | relative_url }}#iso). More information on W3C and the ISO process is in the [W3C PAS FAQ](http://www.w3.org/2010/04/pasfaq). ## Other guidelines {#components} WCAG is part of a series of accessibility guidelines, including the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) and the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG). [Essential Components of Web Accessibility]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}) explains the relationship between the different guidelines. ## Who develops WCAG {#wg} The WCAG technical documents are developed by the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group ([AG WG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/)) *(formerly the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group)*, which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org)) Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)). WAI updates Techniques for WCAG 2 and Understanding WCAG 2 periodically. We welcome [comments]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/commenting/\" | relative_url }}) and [submission of new techniques](http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/TECHS-SUBMIT/).

Some of these include: - **Web content**{:#webcontent} - refers to any part of a website, including text, images, forms, and multimedia, as well as any markup code, scripts, applications, and such. - **User agents**{:#useragents} - software that people use to access web content, including desktop graphical browsers, voice browsers, mobile phone browsers, multimedia players, plug-ins, and some [assistive technologies]({{ \"/people-use-web/tools-techniques/\" | relative_url }}#at \"definition\"). - **Authoring tools**{:#authoringtools} - software or services that people use to produce web content, including code editors, document conversion tools, content management systems, blogs, database scripts, and other tools. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### More about web accessibility standards {:.no_toc} {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} These components inter-relate and support each other. For instance, **web content** needs to include text alternatives for images. This information needs to be processed by **web browsers** and then conveyed to **assistive technologies**, such as screen readers. To create such text alternatives, authors need **authoring tools** that support them to do so. More background is provided in [Essential Components of Web Accessibility]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}). Standards play a vital role in defining accessibility requirements for each of these components. Some accessibility requirements are easy to meet, yet understanding the basics of how people with disabilities use the Web helps implement them more effectively and efficiently. Some aspects of accessibility require more technical skills or advanced knowledge of how people use the Web. In all cases, [involving users early and throughout your web projects]({{ \"/test-evaluate/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}) will make your work better and easier. The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) provides a set of guidelines that are internationally recognized as the standard for web accessibility. These include: - **[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }})** - **[User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/uaag/\" | relative_url }})** - **[Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/atag/\" | relative_url }})** There is also a WAI specification for **[Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php)**, which include dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with Ajax, JavaScript, and related web technologies. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} ## Perceivable information and user interface {#perceivable} ### Text alternatives for non-text content {#alternatives} Text alternatives are equivalents for non-text content. Examples include: - Short equivalents for images, including icons, buttons, and graphics - Description of data represented on charts, diagrams, and illustrations - Brief descriptions of non-text content such as audio and video files - Labels for form controls, input, and other user interface components Text alternatives convey the purpose of an image or function to provide an equivalent user experience. For instance, an appropriate text alternative for a search button would be \"*search*\" rather than \"*magnifying lens*\". Text alternatives can be presented in a variety of ways. For instance, they can be read aloud for people who cannot see the screen and for people with reading difficulties, enlarged to custom text sizes, or displayed on braille devices. Text alternatives serve as labels for controls and functionality to aid keyboard navigation and navigation by voice recognition (speech input). They also act as labels to identify audio, video, and files in other formats, as well as applications that are embedded as part of a website. {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} #### Accessibility requirements related to text alternatives (links to technical specification) {:.no_toc} {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} **WCAG** - [Guideline 1.1 - Text Alternatives](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#text-alternatives) **UAAG** - [Guideline 1.1 - Alternative content](https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/#gl-access-alternative-content) **ATAG** - [Principle A.1: Authoring tool user interfaces follow applicable accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#principle_a1) - [Guideline A.2.1: (For the authoring tool user interface) Make alternative content available to authors](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a21) - [Guideline A.2.2: (For the authoring tool user interface) Ensure that editing-view presentation can be programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a22) - [Guideline A.3.7: (For the authoring tool user interface) Ensure that previews are at least as accessible as in-market user agents](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a37) - [Part B.

Such content includes: - Pages have clear titles and are organized using descriptive section headings - There is more than one way to find relevant pages within a set of web pages - Users are informed about their current location within a set of related pages - There are ways to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple pages - The keyboard focus is visible, and the focus order follows a meaningful sequence - The purpose of a link is evident, ideally even when the link is viewed on its own Meeting this requirement helps people to navigate through web pages in different ways, depending on their particular needs and preferences. For instance, while some people rely on hierarchical navigation structures such as menu bars to find specific web pages, others rely on search functions on websites instead. Some people may be seeing the content while others may be hearing it or seeing and hearing it at the same time.

Yet not everyone can use each of these input modalities, and to the same degree. Particular design considerations maximize the benefit of these input modalities. This includes: - Gestures that require dexterity or fine movement have alternatives that do not require high dexterity - Components are designed to avoid accidental activation, for example by providing undo functionality - Labels presented to users match corresponding object names in the code, to support activation by voice - Functionality that is activated by movement can also be activated through user interface components - Buttons, links, and other active components are large enough to make them easier to activate by touch Meeting this requirement makes the content easier to use for many people with a wide range of abilities using a wide range of devices.

Such content includes: - Identifying the primary language of a web page, such as Arabic, Dutch, or Korean - Identifying the language of text passages, phrases, or other parts of a web page - Providing definitions for any unusual words, phrases, idioms, and abbreviations - Using the clearest and simplest language possible, or providing simplified versions Meeting this requirement helps software, including assistive technology, to process text content correctly. For instance, this requirement helps software to read the content aloud, to generate page summaries, and to provide definitions for unusual words such as technical jargon. It also helps people who have difficulty understanding more complex sentences, phrases, and vocabulary.

Examples of making content more predictable include: - Navigation mechanisms that are repeated on multiple pages appear in the same place each time - User interface components that are repeated on web pages have the same labels each time - Significant changes on a web page do not happen without the consent of the user Meeting this requirement helps people to quickly learn the functionality and navigation mechanisms provided on a website, and to operate them according to their specific needs and preferences. For instance, some people assign personalized shortcut keys to functions they frequently use to enhance keyboard navigation. Others memorize the steps to reach certain pages or to complete processes on a website.

Quick links to resources: * [ATAG at a Glance](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag-glance) * [ATAG 2.0 Standard](http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/) * [Implementing ATAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20/) * [ATAG Report Tool](https://www.w3.org/WAI/atag/report-tool/) {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::options toc_levels=\"2\" /} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"start\" title=\"Page Contents\" %} {:/} - TOC is created automatically. {:toc} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Authoring Tools and ATAG Authoring tools are software and services that \"authors\" (web developers, designers, writers, etc.) use to produce web content (static web pages, dynamic web applications, etc.). Examples of authoring tools are listed below under \"[Who ATAG is for](#who-atag-is-for)\". The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) documents explain how to: - make the authoring tools themselves accessible, so that people with disabilities can create web content, ***and*** - help authors create more accessible web content — specifically: enable, support, and promote the production of content that conforms to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }})). ATAG is part of a series of accessibility guidelines, including the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG). [Essential Components of Web Accessibility]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}) explains the relationship between the different guidelines. ## Who ATAG is for ATAG is primarily for developers of authoring tools, including the following types of authoring tools: - web page authoring tools, for example, what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) HTML editors - software for generating websites, for example, content management systems (CMS) and learning management systems (LMS), courseware tools, content aggregators - software that converts to web content technologies, for example, word processors and other office document applications with Save as HTML or EPUB - multimedia authoring tools - websites that let users add content, such as blogs, wikis, photo sharing sites, online forums, and social networking sites - other types of tools listed in the glossary definition of [authoring tools](http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#def-Authoring-Tool) ATAG and supporting resources are also intended to meet the needs of many different audiences, including policy makers, managers, and others. For example: - People who want to [choose authoring tools](http://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/software) that are accessible and that produce accessible content can use ATAG to evaluate authoring tools. - People who want to encourage their existing authoring tool developer to improve accessibility in future versions can refer the authoring tool vendor to ATAG. ## What is in ATAG 2.0 [**ATAG 2.0**](http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/) has two main parts: - Part A is about making the authoring tool itself accessible. - Part B is about the authoring tool helping authors produce accessible content. **ATAG 2.0** is organized in layers: - **Principles** provide high-level organization for the guidelines. - **Guidelines** provide the framework and objectives for the success criteria. - **Success criteria are the accessibility requirements**, which are written as testable statements, at [three levels](http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#intro_understand_levels_conformance): A, AA, AAA. [**ATAG at a Glance**](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag-glance) provides a short summary of the accessibility principles and guidelines in ATAG 2.0. [**Implementing ATAG 2.0**](http://www.w3.org/TR/IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20/) is a supporting informative document that helps readers understand and use ATAG. Implementing ATAG 2.0 provides the rationale for each guideline; and for each success criterion, it provides the further explanation of the intent of the success criteria, examples, and links to resources. ## ATAG Report Tool The [**ATAG Report Tool**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/atag/report-tool/) helps evaluators report on the accessibility of authoring tools. It guides you through the ATAG requirements, lets you record your evaluation results for each requirement, and generates a report of the authoring tool's ATAG conformance. ## ATAG Versions: 1.0 and 2.0 ATAG 2.0 is a W3C Recommendation. This means that ATAG 2.0 is a completed standard, having received public comments, completed implementation testing, demonstrated real world examples of products that are using ATAG 2.0 to make their products more accessible, and being approved by the W3C membership. (These stages are explained in [How WAI Develops Accessibility Guidelines through the W3C Process](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/w3c-process).) [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-ATAG10-20000203/) was approved in February 2000. While ATAG 1.0 is still a valid standard, it is outdated. ATAG 2.0 is the current standard. ## Translations ATAG 2.0 is available as an Authorized W3C Translation in Chinese, Simplified: [无障碍创作工具指南(ATAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/Translations/ATAG20-zh/). ## Who develops ATAG ATAG was developed by the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines Working Group ([ATAG WG](http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/)), which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org/)) Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/)). For more information about the working group, see the [AUWG page](http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/). [How WAI Develops Accessibility Guidelines through the W3C Process: Milestones and Opportunities to Contribute](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/w3c-process) describes formal periods for public review. Opportunities for review and comment of WAI documents are announced on the [WAI home page](http://www.w3.org/WAI/) and [WAI Interest Group](http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/) mailing list.

Some resources are integral part of the teaching while others are optional further reading. Terminology specifically related to people with disabilities, assistive technologies, and adaptive strategies is provided in [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](/people-use-web). ## Essentials for Teaching Accessibility The following tips help you provide more effective courses, training, and certification programs on accessibility: * **Involve people with disabilities** &mdash; Involve people with disabilities in your courses so that students get perspectives from real people on the impact of accessibility barriers and accessibility features. Invite people with disabilities to show how they use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies, the accessibility features they rely on, and barriers they encounter. If you cannot invite people with disabilities, consider using videos instead. Yet make sure to guide your students through the process to avoid perpetuating existing misunderstandings. For guidance on working with people with disabilities, ethical considerations, and cautions, see [Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility]({{ \"/planning/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}). * **Include the reasons for accessibility features** &mdash; Include the *why*, not just the *how*. For example, students should know why to provide text alternatives, not just how to. Students learn and implement accessibility more effectively when they understand the reasons behind accessibility features and how people with disabilities use them. * **Cover all disabilities** &mdash; Avoid inadvertently prioritizing some types of disabilities over others. Digital accessibility is essential for people with many different types of disabilities, including auditory, cognitive and learning, physical, speech, and visual. For guidance on cross-disability aspects, see [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](/people-use-web). * **Approach accessibility holistically** &mdash; Communicate accessibility as part of the broader umbrella of inclusion and diversity. Explain that accessibility is not effectively addressed with a checklist mindset. The goal of accessibility is to improve the user experience for people with disabilities. It provides many benefits, including for users without disabilities. For an explanation of how accessibility is related to usability and inclusive design, see [Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion]({{ \"/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/\" | relative_url }}). * **Make it accessible** &mdash; Ensure that the course itself is accessible. For example: * all presentations, teaching materials, exercises, assessments, and other student interactions are accessible * the online learning platform, the classroom, computer lab, and training venue are accessible * captions, sign-language, and large-print is provided when needed * instructors describe visual information, including text on the screen For specific guidance on making your training accessible, see [How to Make Your Presentations Accessible to All]({{ \"/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/\" | relative_url }}).",

For example, they can affect people's perception, memory, language, attention, problem solving, and comprehension. Terminology for categories and conditions varies, and includes intellectual disabilities, developmental disabilities; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, dementia, dyslexia, and more. Technology provides opportunities for people to interact with content and to process information in ways that are more usable to them. For example, people can: * navigate web content using different strategies * access information in text, audio, or other formats * change the presentation of the content according to their individual needs or preferences There are many things that designers and developers can do to: * avoid accessibility barriers that exclude people from using their products * optimize the user experience of people with cognitive and learning disabilities Specific examples of cognitive and learning disabilities and examples of accessibility barriers are in this section of \"How People with Disabilities Use the Web: Diverse Abilities and Barriers\": [Cognitive and learning](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/abilities-barriers/#cognitive). ## Cognitive Accessibility in W3C Standards Existing and developing standards from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) address many aspects of cognitive accessibility. For example, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)) includes requirements that address cognitive accessibility. The requirements (called “success criteria”) are in these and other guidelines: * [Guideline 1.3 Adaptable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/adaptable): Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure. * [Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/distinguishable): Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background. * [Guideline 2.2 Enough Time](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/enough-time): Provide users enough time to read and use content. * [Guideline 2.4 Navigable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/navigable): Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are. * [Guideline 3.1 Readable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/readable): Make text content readable and understandable. * [Guideline 3.2 Predictable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/predictable): Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways. * [Guideline 3.3 Input Assistance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/input-assistance): Help users avoid and correct mistakes. Additional guidance on cognitive accessibility is include in the WCAG Understanding documents and Techniques, including Advisory Techniques. These documents are introduced in a section of the WCAG Overview: [What is in the WCAG 2 Documents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/#whatis2). ## Additional Support for Cognitive Accessibility Some cognitive accessibility user needs are not addressed in existing W3C standards. W3C is actively working to provide additional guidance on cognitive accessibility, including: * updating \"supplemental guidance\" beyond what fits into accessibility standards now * developing additional requirements to be included in future versions of WCAG * developing standards for [personalization](https://www.w3.org/WAI/personalization/), which is a key aspect of cognitive accessibility ### Supplemental Guidance: Content Usable **[Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/)** (“Content Usable”) helps you increase accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. It includes: * aims and objectives for usable content * design patterns (ways) to make content usable * including users in design and testing activities * personas (user stories) and user needs The Content Usable document is an informative Working Group Note (not a W3C standard). It provides “supplemental guidance” beyond the requirements of WCAG 2. **It is not required for conformance to WCAG**. WAI is currently working on integrating the Objectives and Patterns from Content Usable in a new section of the WAI website. That will be easier for some people to use. We welcome comments for the next version of Content Usable.

W3C's Web standards are called W3C Recommendations. All W3C standards are reviewed for accessibility support by the Accessible Platform Architectures ([APA]({{ \"/about/groups/apawg/\" | relative_url }})) Working Group. The W3C standards and Working Group Notes introduced below are particularly relevant to accessibility. ## Accessibility Guidelines {#guidelines} [Essential Components of Web Accessibility]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}) shows how web accessibility depends on several components of web development and interaction working together, and how the WAI guidelines (WCAG, ATAG, UAAG) apply. ### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 {#wcag2} Web \"content\" generally refers to the information in a web page or web application, including: * natural information such as text, images, and sounds * code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc. WCAG applies to dynamic content, multimedia, \"mobile\", etc. WCAG can also be applied to non-web information and communications technologies (ICT), as described in [WCAG2ICT]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/non-web-ict/\" | relative_url }}). WCAG 2 info: - [WCAG Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}) - [WCAG 2.1 at a Glance]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/\" | relative_url }}) - [How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) - [WCAG 2 Translations]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/translations/\" | relative_url }}) - [WCAG 2.0 Standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) - [WCAG 2.1 Standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), [What’s New in WCAG 2.1]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/\" | relative_url }}) - [What's New in WCAG 2.2 Working Draft]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/\" | relative_url }}) ### Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) {#atag} Authoring tools are software and services that \"authors\" (web developers, designers, writers, etc.) use to produce web content. For example: HTML editors, content management systems (CMS), and websites that let users add content, such as blogs and social networking sites. ATAG documents explain how to: * make the authoring tools themselves accessible, so that people with disabilities can create web content, and * help authors create more accessible web content. ATAG info: - [ATAG Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/atag/\" | relative_url }}) - [ATAG at a Glance]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/atag/glance/\" | relative_url }}) - [ATAG 2.0 Standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG/) ### User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) {#uaag} User agents include browsers, browser extensions, media players, readers, and other applications that render web content. UAAG info: - [UAAG Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/uaag/\" | relative_url }}) - [UAAG 2.0 Note](https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/) ### W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3 Working Draft {#wcag3} WCAG 3 is an early draft that is intended to become a W3C Standard. WCAG 3 applies to web content, apps, tools, publishing, and emerging technologies on the web. WCAG 3 info: - [WCAG 3 Introduction]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/wcag3-intro/\" | relative_url }}) ## Technical Specifications ### Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) {#aria} ARIA provides semantics so authors can convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies (such as screen readers). The ARIA specification provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements. The ARIA suite includes API mapping specifications that provide user agent implementation guidance. It also include modules for Graphics and Digital Publishing. ARIA info: - [WAI-ARIA Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/aria/\" | relative_url }}) – includes a [list and description of modules and API mappings]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/aria/\" | relative_url }}#versions) - [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) - [WAI-ARIA 1.1 Standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/) ### Audio and Video {#multimedia} - [WebVTT: The Web Video Text Tracks Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt/) is a format for captions, text video descriptions, and other metadata that is time-aligned with audio or video content. - [Timed Text Markup Language (TTML)](https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml/) is intended to be used for transcoding or exchanging timed text information among legacy distribution content formats for subtitling and captioning. ### Evaluation {#eval} The following resources support development of accessibility evaluation methods and tools: - [Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/act/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; ACT establishes and documents rules for testing the conformance of web content to accessibility standards. - [Evaluation and Report Language (EARL) Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/earl/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; EARL is a machine-readable format for expressing test results. Additional resources related to evaluation are listed in the [Evaluating Web Accessibility Overview]({{ \"/test-evaluate/\" | relative_url }}), including: - [WCAG-EM Overview: Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology]({{ \"/test-evaluate/conformance/wcag-em/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; WCAG-EM is an approach for determining how well a website conforms to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). ### Personalization [Personalization Overview]({{ \"/personalization/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; Personalization involves tailoring the user experience to meet the needs and preferences of the individual user. Content authors can use personalization standards to provide a default design and enable user personalization with minimal work. ### Pronunciation [Pronunciation Overview]({{ \"/pronunciation/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; Pronunciation is about screen readers and other text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis pronouncing content properly. ## Other Areas of W3C WAI work - [Mobile Accessibility at W3C]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/mobile/\" | relative_url }}) - [Cognitive Accessibility at W3C]({{ \"/cognitive/\" | relative_url }}) ## Additional Information {#moreinfo} - [List of all W3C accessibility-related Standards (\"W3C Recommendations\") and Working Group Notes](https://www.w3.org/TR/?tag=accessibility) - [Web Accessibility Laws & Policies]({{ \"/policies/\" | relative_url }}) lists governmental laws and policies relating to web accessibility in countries and regions around the world.

    "title": "Pronunciation Overview",
    "text": "{::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Summary\" class=\"\" %} {:/} This page introduces work to enable screen readers and voice assistants to pronounce words correctly. The goal is to provide standards and best practices for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis of HTML content. Quick link to latest publication: * [Specification for Spoken Presentation in HTML _(Working Draft Note)_](https://www.w3.org/TR/spoken-html/) {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {% include toc.html %} ## Introduction Most people who are blind rely on text-to-speech (TTS) software called screen readers. Some people with cognitive disabilities who have difficulty processing written text also use screen readers. Text-to-speech is essential for people with disabilities and useful for all. TTS is now widely used in popular applications such as voice assistants. Many computers and mobile devices today have built in text-to-speech functionality that is used by people without disabilities in different situations, such as when they lose their glasses or their eyes are tired. Accurate pronunciation is essential in many situations, such as education and assessment (testing students). Currently text-to-speech pronunciation is often inaccurate and inconsistent because of technology limitations. For example, incorrect pronunciation may be based on context, regional variation, or emphasis. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Examples:\" %} {:/} The address:\"123 Maple Dr., St. Paul, Minn\" is often spoken by TTS as:\"123 maple doctor, street paul, min\" instead of:\"123 Maple Drive, Saint Paul, Minnesota\". \"Reading\" is pronounced differently if it is the city in England or in the phrase \"reading a book\". {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} W3C is developing normative specifications (standards) and guidance on best practices so that text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis pronounce HTML content (for example, web pages) correctly. This will allow content creators specify how words should be pronounced. ## Explainer and User Scenarios [Explainer: Improving Spoken Presentation on the Web](https://www.w3.org/TR/pronunciation-explainer/) provides an overview of the work. It: - Briefly introduces the context for W3C work on pronunciation - Describes the advantages and disadvantages of two approaches - Poses questions for additional input [Pronunciation User Scenarios](https://www.w3.org/TR/pronunciation-user-scenarios/) provides examples of: - End-users, including screen reader users - Content providers, including educators - Software developers, including content management systems ## Exploring Technical Solutions The Pronunciation Task Force has been exploring technical options for content authors to provide pronunciation information. A challenge is developing a solution that will be used by screen readers. One aspect of that work is analyzing how required features for accurate pronunciation are covered in existing technical specifications, including HTML5. [Pronunciation Gap Analysis and Use Cases](https://www.w3.org/TR/pronunciation-gap-analysis-and-use-cases/) provides details on the analysis. It: - Provides more detailed context - Describes required features for pronunciation and spoken presentation - Describes specific implementation approaches for introducing presentation authoring markup into HTML5 (called “use cases”) - Provides a gap analysis - Describes how the required features may be met by existing approaches **[Specification for Spoken Presentation in HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/spoken-html/)** provides details on two markup approaches. Both satisfy the requirements and provide consistent results. We seek feedback from authors and implementors on which approach would be most implementable across all spoken presentation applications. ## Who Develops the Pronunciation Documents Pronunciation documents are developed by the [Pronunciation Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/task-forces/pronunciation/) of the [Accessible Platform Working Group (APA WG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/), which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org)) Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/)). For more information about the Task Force, see the [Pronunciation Task Force page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/task-forces/pronunciation/). ## Contributing to the Work Opportunities for contributing to Pronunciation and other WAI work are introduced in [Participating in WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/participating/). To get notifications of drafts for review, see [Get WAI News](https://www.w3.org/WAI/news/subscribe/) for links to WAI tweets, RSS feed, and WAI Interest Group (WAI IG) emails.

    "text": "{::nomarkdown} {% include_cached box.html type=\"start\" h=\"2\" title=\"Summary\" class=\"full\" %} {:/} This article examines the rationale for organizations to address accessibility. It includes tangible and intangible benefits, and the risks of not addressing accessibility adequately. It explores how accessibility can: - Drive Innovation: Accessibility features in products and services often solve unanticipated problems. - Enhance Your Brand: Diversity and inclusion efforts so important to business success are accelerated with a clear, well-integrated accessibility commitment. - Extend Market Reach: The global market of people with disabilities is over 1 billion people with a spending power of more than $6 trillion. Accessibility often improves the online experience for all users. - Minimize Legal Risk: Many countries have laws requiring digital accessibility, and the issue is of increased legal concern. Note that \"web accessibility\" and \"websites\" throughout this article include web and mobile applications and other digital technologies. {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached box.html type=\"end\" %} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"start\" title=\"Page Contents\" class=\"simple\" %} {:/} {::options toc_levels=\"2,3\" /} - The TOC will replace this text. {:toc} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Is there a Business Case for Accessibility? A business case is a necessary tool for organizations when planning for various initiatives. Whether an organization is commercial, educational, non-profit, or governmental, most require justification for dedicating resources such as money or effort in support of a specific organizational policy or goal. \"Business” in this article refers to all types of organizations with the understanding that different aspects will be relevant depending on the organizational focus and purpose. For example, government agencies may be strongly motivated by legal and equity aspects. Commercial businesses may be more persuaded by innovation and market expansion opportunities. Educational and nonprofit businesses may be especially drawn to brand enhancement. To create a compelling business case, it is important to highlight the most relevant accessibility benefits within your specific operational landscape. There are both tangible and intangible benefits to businesses that dedicate resources to digital accessibility. A frequent argument against the accessibility business case is that the direct return on investment (ROI) is too difficult to measure. ROI is important of course, but not by any means the only way to measure how an accessibility commitment benefits organizations of all kinds. A useful business case also presents the cost and risk of inaction. It is most likely your business will respond to a mix of motivating factors as you consider implementing an integrated accessibility program. This article provides research and examples to inspire confidence among leaders and decision makers that continued investment in accessibility is good for your business. **Businesses that integrate accessibility are more likely to be innovative, inclusive enterprises that reach more people with positive brand messaging that meets emerging global legal requirements.** A research study of Fortune 100 companies indicates that disability inclusion, as part of an overall diversity strategy, is common practice among high performing businesses.[^1] When accessibility is part of strategic planning, businesses are better equipped for success in our connected world of commerce, academia, and civic engagement. Let’s look at some examples and research outcomes that will help you make the business case that is most effective in your business environment. ## Accessibility is good for business Many organisations are waking up to the fact that embracing accessibility leads to multiple benefits – reducing legal risks, strengthening brand presence, improving customer experience and colleague productivity. Paul Smyth, Head of Digital Accessibility, Barclays The sections below explore key advantages of web accessibility to businesses of all types. Real world examples are presented to show how benefits are realized in the global marketplace. ### Drive Innovation Integrating accessibility removes architectural, digital, and social barriers that can get in the way of innovation[^2], for example: - Accessible design thinking provides varied and flexible ways for users to interact with websites and applications, options that are useful for people with and without disabilities. - Design of user interaction considers experiences other than screens when accessibility is a consideration. The result is interaction that is more human-centered, natural, and contextual. - Accessibility is closely related to general usability – both aim to define and deliver a more intuitive user experience. - Innovations like the typewriter, telephone, punch cards, text to speech, email, and voice controls were initially meant to include those with a disability, and all have found a much broader application.[^4] - Driverless cars, so promising for the independence of blind people, are projected to also help solve traffic fatalities and congestion. - Research and development of the artificial retina project to help restore sight for participants who are blind may also help future robots with real-time image-processing systems, effectively enabling them to \"see.\" [^3] Accessible design is by its nature flexible, allowing content to faithfully render across a broad spectrum of devices, platforms, assistive technologies, and operating systems. In physical environments, everyone takes advantage of lower curbs, automatic door openers, ramps, and other features provided for disability access. On the web, accessibility features become options that are also often used more widely. A compelling example comes from the early 2000’s, when people increasingly used mobile devices to browse the web. Accessible and standards-compliant websites were in many cases more mobile-ready as they did not rely on mouse input. Imagine the delight of those who were already committed to and had designed for accessibility! This revelation led to the responsive-design trend that has accessibility at its core.[^5] The following case studies from two large technology companies provide useful examples for companies of all sizes. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"4\" title=\"Case Study: Apple \" class=\"\" %} {:/} Accessibility is a core value at Apple and something we view as a basic human right. Sarah Herrlinger, Director of Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives, Apple Apple engineers have been innovators in the accessibility space since the inception of the company, both willing to listen and work with outside constituents. [^6] The company also anticipates market direction by integrating disability needs into product development. Examples include: - iTunes U: In the early 2000’s, the 23-campus California State University system was unable to take advantage of Apple’s iTunes U educational program because the application was not fully accessible to blind students. Teachers within the CSU system were prohibited from using it. This was resolved by innovation, not litigation, as Apple listened to CSU’s concerns and worked to make iTunes accessible on both the Mac and Windows platforms. CSU System was soon able to use the program widely. - VoiceOver on iPhone: Early in the evolution of the iPhone, Apple began considering the implications that a touchscreen device would have on their blind customers. Iterating over several years behind the scenes, the company invested the resources to develop the voice technology that led to VoiceOver, the world’s first gesture-based screen reader. Within weeks of launch, Apple received a special commendation from the National Federation of the Blind \"For designing the first fully accessible touchscreen interface.” [^7] Screen readers on other touch screen devices have now become more prevalent in the industry and Apple has shown important leadership in the effort to ensure inclusion for all. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} Innovation from voice interactions at Apple and elsewhere have contributed to the abundance of personal digital assistants now found in many homes and offices. Today millions of people use these devices, regardless of ability. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"4\" title=\"Case Study: Google \" class=\"\" %} {:/} The accessibility problems of today are the mainstream breakthroughs of tomorrow. Eve Andersson, Director, Accessibility Engineering, Google A 2016 article in the FastCompany online magazine[^8] highlights how Google’s investment in accessibility provides the company with an innovation edge in a broad array of products and services. Eve Andersson, the lead engineer, featured in the article, says “I’m passionate about accessibility, not just because I believe in a level playing field, but because (it) makes life more livable for everyone.” Among the innovations cited as examples are these: - contrast minimums, required for people with low vision, help all people see in bright light glare situations - auto-complete, initially provided for people with disabilities, is now widely used by all - voice control, implemented for users with physical impairments, has been more widely adopted as a great convenience by millions of others - artificial intelligence advances are based on research originally done to provide visual context to users with visual impairments - auto-captioning using machine learning has been problematic for the main target population of deaf users and many feel it is still inadequate to meet that need. However, work continues and machine learning itself is steadily improving and has found broader applications due to this effort. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ### Enhance Your Brand Businesses need to protect and enhance their brands. A clear commitment to accessibility can demonstrate that a business has a genuine sense of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). As businesses understand and act on the diverse needs of their stakeholders and make the commitment to sustainable, inclusive marketing and employment practices, they can achieve a range of benefits. Potential outcomes for CSR programs include enhanced brand image and reputation, increased sales and customer loyalty, improved workforce diversity and many other benefits.[^9] Further studies[^10] emphasize the benefits to the brand of companies that institute policies of broad diversity. Employing people with disabilities is an essential aspect of creating a diverse workforce. To be successful, the technology that employees use, including websites and applications, must be accessible. Barclays shared their approach to diversity and inclusion through the accessibility initiatives in their company and how that approach has made them a better company. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"4\" title=\"Case Study: Barclays\" class=\"\" %} {:/} Establishing an organisation-wide accessibility strategy for identifying, anticipating and addressing the additional needs of customers and colleagues with impairments contributes in several ways to our brand identity – through tailored services, fostering an inclusive culture, creating new ways to communicate and consult with existing and potential customers. At Barclays, accessibility is about more than just disability. It's about helping everyone to work, bank and live their lives regardless of their age, situation, abilities or circumstances.Paul Smyth, Head of Digital Accessibility, Barclays We want to leverage inclusive technology to enable and empower all people to bank, work and reach their full potential. The Barclays Accessibility team does this by supporting digital teams to embed accessibility into our services and culture through effective governance, partnering, training, and tools. Establishing an enterprise-wide accessibility strategy, standards and programmes coupled with senior sponsorship helps support our publicly stated ambition of becoming the most accessible and inclusive Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) company. When we shift our thinking away from the minimum legal compliance to focus instead on the commercial opportunity and the creative challenge of building better experiences for everyone, we create a more sustainable, customer orientated approach to digital information and services. To help everyone understand Barclays accessibility-focused mindset, we've created a range of animations which help our colleagues understand what accessibility is all about, who benefits, and what the different types of impairments are. We've also shared these animations on our [Accessible Banking YouTube playlist {% include_cached external.html %}](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLecqH2uhOR0Zb31X7hh5BzWJv4KGLnuUy). {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} Barclays demonstrates how a strong commitment to accessibility results in distributed responsibility and shared understanding. Accessibility awareness permeates the company culture. The company is perceived as open and fair. People are proud to work there and to do business with Barclays. Read the [full Barclays case study](https://www.w3.org/community/wai-engage/wiki/Barclays_Bank_Case_Study) to learn more. Another well-recognized example of how a brand can be affected is Microsoft. After long advocacy and some criticism by accessibility advocates [^11], Microsoft made a real and appreciable commitment to accessibility demonstrated by genuine engagement with stakeholders of all abilities.[^12] The resulting improvements to products and services have strengthened its overall brand image [^13], and accessibility efforts are now lauded in the community of people with disabilities.[^14] ### Increase Market Reach The market of people with disabilities is large and growing as the global population ages. In the UK, where the large disability market is known as the Purple Pound, people with disabilities and their families spend at least £249 billion every year. In the US, the annual discretionary spending of people with disabilities is over $200 billion. The global estimate of the disability market is nearly $7 trillion. Consider these facts when estimating market size: - At least one billion people – 15% of the world’s population – have a recognized disability[^15] - As the population ages, many more acquire disability and yet do not identify as a “person with a disability”[^16] - In countries with life expectancies of over 70 years of age, people spend 11.5 percent of their lifespan living with a disability.[^17] - Globally, the extended market is estimated at 2.3 billion people who control an incremental $6.9 trillion in annual disposable income.[^18] A Forrester Research Economic Impact Study commissioned by Microsoft concluded that accessibility could contribute to cost savings when it is integrated into existing and ongoing development cycles. [^19] Technology updates and redesigns that include accessibility along with other best practices have demonstrated reduced costs for maintenance and service. Moreover, according to Microsoft, as accessibility features are included, overall customer satisfaction improves. Designing inclusive software results in improved usability and customer satisfaction. Microsoft’s app developer guide Accessible design considerations often lead to improvements in general customer experience and loyalty. For customers with disabilities, such improvements are essential for equal access. However, accessibility provides options that are useful to all customers in various situations. For example, web accessibility also benefits: * people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc., * older people with changing abilities due to ageing, * people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm or lost glasses, * challenging situations like bright, glaring sunlight or noisy environments where audio can't be heard, * those with a slow internet connection, limited or expensive bandwidth, which is common in rural areas and some geographical regions. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"4\" title=\"Case Study: NPR Weekly Broadcast \" class=\"\" %} {:/} This American Life is a broadcast heard on more than 500 National Public Radio (NPR) stations by about 2.1 million listeners each week in the United States. In 2011, in response to new regulations around broadcast media from the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the broadcaster committed to creating transcripts for their entire archive of recorded programs. A study by their media partner, conducted over several months, concluded that the provision of transcripts not only met legal obligations but returned significant benefits including: - search traffic increased 6.86%, - better comprehension for visitors who use English as a second language, - visitors were able to use transcripts in noisy or sound-sensitive environments, - ability to more easily translate, and - ability to search text to reference a specific section of audio. The study, conducted over more than one year, used Google Analytics to capture the following data: - 7.23% of visitors viewed at least one transcript, - unique visitors increased 4.18%, and - new inbound links to transcript accounted for an increase of 3.89% Read more detail and the full report of the [This American Life Case Study {% include_cached external.html %}](https://www.3playmedia.com/customers/case-studies/this-american-life/) and how it was conducted. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ### Minimize Legal Risk {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" class=\"simple right\" %} {:/} A significant demonstration of the risk of ignoring accessibility requirements was the 2008 settlement by the National Federation of the Blind with Target retailers:[^20] - class damages of $6 million - plaintiff legal fees over $3 million - undisclosed defense legal fees - court oversight of website for several years {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} Consideration of the cost and risk of inaction is a critical aspect of any business case. As web use is woven into modern life all over the world, governments and regulators began to mandate laws and policies that strengthen the rights of people with disabilities to participate in online digital information and services. One of the earliest examples of legal consequences to web accessibility was a complaint put to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission (HREOC) in 2000 about the inaccessibility of the website of the Sydney Olympics. The plaintiff, who was blind, claimed the site was a violation of the Commonwealth Disability Discrimination Act 1992.[^21] The 2001 decision in the Sydney Olympics suit[^22] raised awareness of the need to address accessibility in the emerging practice of web communication. Over time, the legal risk increased with the adoption of more specific laws and policies in countries throughout the world. - The Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD) is a comprehensive human rights document that includes a direct reference to the rights of all people to have equal access to communications technology. Passed by the General Assembly of the United Nations, more than 175 countries ratified it by 2018. - The European Commission adopted the European Accessibility Act, requiring ATMs and banking services, PCs, telephones and TV equipment, telephony and audiovisual services, transport, e-books, and e-commerce meet accessibility requirements. - In the US, the number of legal actions continues to rise and courts increasingly decide in favor of equal access[^23], often citing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Structured Negotiation is another way that legal pressure is effective, encouraging companies to meet accessibility requirements while avoiding litigation.[^24] In Norway where it is now illegal for commercial websites to fail to provide equivalent access for people with disabilities, the government fines commercial companies that do not comply.[^25] Austria has had customer protection regulation in place since 2006 requiring most public websites to meet accessibility standards. Customers that believe they have been discriminated against can take legal action. Parties meet in mediation before they are permitted to go to court. In the United States, by contrast, the regulation is less clear but legal action continues to accelerate.[^26] Between government oversight and regulation on the one hand, and increased legal action on the other, the legal landscape is rapidly changing in favor of equal access. **With legal risks increasing, smart businesses – particularly those with global activities – are creating accessibility policies and programs to mitigate risk to protect both their assets and their reputations.** {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"4\" title=\"Case Study: ADA and Website Accessibility \" class=\"\" %} {:/} The blind plaintiff shopped at the local Winn-Dixie grocery store and pharmacy in person but was unable to access the website for information such as the store locator, coupons, store events, and specials. The historic suit was the first trial in the history of the ADA about the accessibility of a public accommodation’s website. Winn-Dixie asked the court to dismiss the suit based on their argument that a website is not a public accommodation covered by Title III of the ADA. The court decided otherwise, allowing the plaintiff to recover their attorney fees. The decision included the following conclusions by the court: - The link between the website and Winn-Dixie Stores was a circumstance that made Title III of the ADA, applicable to “Public Accommodations,” relevant in this situation. - The website must be made accessible to *“individuals with disabilities who use computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.”* The court required the chain of grocery stores to - adopt and post an explicit Accessibility Policy *“to ensure the persons with disabilities have full and equal enjoyment of its website and shall accompany the public policy statement with an accessible means of submitting accessibility questions and problems.”* - conduct annual accessibility training for IT and web staff, so they learn to create and maintain content that meets WCAG criteria. - make sure that any third-party applications or content posted to the Winn-Dixie site must also meet WCAG requirements. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Share your experience User experience research and case studies confirm the many ways that accessible design supports an organization’s ability to innovate, enhance their brand, increase market reach, and minimize legal risk – among many other benefits. The WAI is a global community of practice, and we encourage you to share your examples. If you have a story of how your commitment to accessibility improved your online business model, please submit it via email to or post it to the [WAI-Engage wiki](https://www.w3.org/community/wai-engage/wiki/Case_studies). ## Conclusion Public use of the web is more than 25 years old. It is no longer a novelty but an integrated, critical tool of modern life. As smart businesses integrate accessible design into their development and procurement processes, they understand the need for equal access by all people. The legal risks of ignoring accessibility are significant, and the benefits have also been demonstrated by leaders like Apple, Barclays, NPR, IBM, Microsoft and hundreds more. Business leaders and the advocates who influence them can have tremendous social impact and a healthy return on investment as they follow a roadmap that leads to equal access. More than one billion people with disabilities in the world are eager to engage with you as customers, clients, partners, employees, and equal participants in civic and social activities. By developing a long-term commitment to accessibility and by using WAI resources to develop policy and implement a strategy to bring that commitment to life, your business will reach this market and is likely to thrive in unexpected and self-sustaining ways. ## Resources This article was written after reading and exploring many external resources that shaped our understanding of the current landscape. We have provided links and notes about our research in this [Annotated Bibliography]({{ \"/business-case/bibliography/\" | relative_url }}). Also, the WAI website has an extensive library of useful support to help companies realize the benefits outlined in this article for integrating accessibility into their development, procurement, and general business practice. Listed below are a few of what we consider especially useful as you start your accessibility program. * [Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility]({{ \"/planning/org-policies/\" | relative_url }}): Start with a clear policy. * [Planning and Managing Accessibility]({{ \"/planning-and-managing/\" | relative_url }}): A guide for implementation. * [Web Accessibility Perspectives Videos: Explore the Impact and Benefits for Everyone]({{ \"/perspective-videos/\" | relative_url }}): Watch how accessibility impacts users. These are suggested merely as a way to get started. We hope you will explore throughout the WAI site as you dive deeper into accessibility and begin to realize the related benefits for you and your organization.

W3C's web standards are called ***W3C Recommendations***. WAI has developed several W3C Recommendations, including: - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, see [WCAG Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}) - Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines, see [ATAG Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/atag/\" | relative_url }}) - User Agent Accessibility Guidelines, see [UAAG Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/uaag/\" | relative_url }}) - Accessible Rich Internet Applications, see [WAI-ARIA Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/aria/\" | relative_url }}) **\\[WAI Accessibility Guidelines\\] that are \\[W3C Recommendations\\] are \\[Web Standards\\]** ### Milestones {#milestones} The milestones that a W3C \"technical report\" goes through on its way to becoming a W3C Recommendation are listed below. {:#stages} **Editor's Drafts** have no official standing, do not imply consensus of a Working Group, and are not endorsed by W3C. 1. {:#wd}![draft documents:]({{ \"/content-images/wai-about-w3c-process/wd.gif\" | relative_url }}){:style=\"float:left; margin-right: 1em; clear: left;\"} **Working Draft**: Working Drafts are published and announced specifically to ask for review and input from the community. Often there are issues that a Working Group would particularly like input on. Usually multiple Working Drafts of a technical report are published. 2. {:#lcwd}![complete technical report:]({{ \"/content-images/wai-about-w3c-process/lcwd.gif\" | relative_url }}){:style=\"float:left; margin-right: 1em; clear: left;\"} **Wide Review Working Draft**: When a Working Group believes it has addressed all comments and technical requirements, it provides the complete document for community review and announces that it is ready for wide review. 3. {:#cr}![using computer with technical report:]({{ \"/content-images/wai-about-w3c-process/cr.gif\" | relative_url }}){:style=\"float:left; margin-right: 1em; clear: left;\"} **Candidate Recommendation**: The main purpose of Candidate Recommendation is to ensure that the technical report can be implemented. W3C encourages developers to use the technical report in their projects. The technical report is stable at this stage; however, it may change based on implementation experience. 4. {:#pr}![endorsing technical report:]({{ \"/content-images/wai-about-w3c-process/pr.gif\" | relative_url }}){:style=\"float:left; margin-right: 1em; clear: left;\"} **Proposed Recommendation**: After there are implementations of each feature of the technical report, W3C announces it as a Proposed Recommendation. At this stage, the report is submitted to the W3C Membership for endorsement. 5. {:#rec}![approved technical report:]({{ \"/content-images/wai-about-w3c-process/rec.gif\" | relative_url }}){:style=\"float:left; margin-right: 1em; clear: left;\"} **W3C Recommendation (Web Standard)**: Once there is significant support for the technical report from the W3C Members, the W3C Director, and the public, it is published as a Recommendation. W3C encourages widespread deployment of its Recommendations. That was a simplified description of the process. For the definitive version, see the [W3C Process Document, Section 7: W3C Technical Report Development Process](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Reports). ## Other Resources {#other} WAI also develops documents that support the guidelines and do not go through the process described above. {:#other_docs} - **W3C Working Group Notes** are advisory technical reports, not standards. - **WAI Resources** and EOWG Resources cover a wide range of web accessibility topics, such as [Essential Components of Web Accessibility]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}), [WCAG 2 at a Glance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/), [Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility]({{ \"/test-evaluate/preliminary/\" | relative_url }}), and many others listed in the [WAI Resources](https://www.w3.org/WAI/resources/). ## Get WAI News for Community Collaboration {#community} To get WAI announcements of Working Drafts for review via e-mail, Twitter, or Atom/RSS feed, **see [Get WAI News](https://www.w3.org/WAI/news/subscribe/)**. WAI's W3C Recommendations, Working Group Notes, and Resources are developed in [WAI Working Groups]({{ \"/about/groups/\" | relative_url }}) with input from the community. WAI actively encourages broad participation from industry, disability organizations, accessibility researchers, government, and others interested in web accessibility. **[Participating in WAI]({{ \"/get-involved/\" | relative_url }})** describes ways that you can contribute to WAI's accessibility work, including reviewing and commenting on WAI guidelines as they are being developed. **The best time to comment is when WAI announces Working Drafts for review**. Please send your comments early in the process, when the Working Group can most effectively address them in the developing technical report. Technical comments sent after the wide review period have less weight, and a Working Group might not be able to make substantive changes late in the process.

W3C's Web standards are called W3C Recommendations. All W3C standards are reviewed for accessibility support by the Accessible Platform Architectures ([APA]({{ \"/about/groups/apawg/\" | relative_url }})) Working Group. The W3C standards and Working Group Notes introduced below are particularly relevant to accessibility. ### Accessibility Guidelines {#guidelines} [Essential Components of Web Accessibility]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}) shows how web accessibility depends on several components of web development and interaction working together, and how the WAI guidelines (WCAG, ATAG, UAAG) apply. #### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) {#wcag} Web \"content\" generally refers to the information in a web page or web application, including: * natural information such as text, images, and sounds * code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc. WCAG applies to dynamic content, multimedia, \"mobile\", etc. WCAG can also be applied to non-web information and communications technologies (ICT), as described in [WCAG2ICT]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/non-web-ict/\" | relative_url }}). WCAG info: - [WCAG Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}) - [WCAG 2.1 at a Glance]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/\" | relative_url }}) - [How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) - [WCAG 2.0 Standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) - [WCAG 2.1 Standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) #### Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) {#atag} Authoring tools are software and services that \"authors\" (web developers, designers, writers, etc.) use to produce web content. For example: HTML editors, content management systems (CMS), and websites that let users add content, such as blogs and social networking sites. ATAG documents explain how to: * make the authoring tools themselves accessible, so that people with disabilities can create web content, and * help authors create more accessible web content.

UAAG info: - [UAAG Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/uaag/\" | relative_url }}) - [UAAG 2.0 Note](https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/) ### Technical Specifications #### Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) {#aria} ARIA provides semantics so authors can convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies (such as screen readers). The ARIA specification provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements. The ARIA suite includes API mapping specifications that provide user agent implementation guidance. It also include modules for Graphics and Digital Publishing. ARIA info: - [WAI-ARIA Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/aria/\" | relative_url }}) – includes a [list and description of modules and API mappings]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/aria/\" | relative_url }}#versions) - [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) - [WAI-ARIA 1.1 Standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/) #### Audio and Video {#multimedia} - [WebVTT: The Web Video Text Tracks Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt/) is a format for captions, text video descriptions, and other metadata that is time-aligned with audio or video content. - [Timed Text Markup Language (TTML)](https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml/) is intended to be used for transcoding or exchanging timed text information among legacy distribution content formats for subtitling and captioning. #### Evaluation {#eval} The following resources support development of accessibility evaluation methods and tools: - [Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/act/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; ACT establishes and documents rules for testing the conformance of web content to accessibility standards. - [Evaluation and Report Language (EARL) Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/earl/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; EARL is a machine-readable format for expressing test results.

To learn about how such policies form part of a broader approach to implementing accessibility, see [Planning and Managing Web Accessibility]({{ \"/planning-and-managing/\" | relative_url }}). {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::options toc_levels=\"2\" /} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"start\" title=\"Page Contents\" class=\"simple full\" %} {:/} - TOC is created automatically. {:toc} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ### Designing a policy {#about} Your web accessibility policy may be standalone or integrated into other policies. The accessibility policy could be part of a non-discrimination or equal opportunity policy. Other related documents should also mention web accessibility. For example, brand guidelines, coding standards, and project management frameworks. This helps considering accessibility as a core feature, rather than an afterthought. Your organizational policy may not be suitable for the public if it is an internal document. Consider providing a public accessibility statement that reflects your policy, goals, and achievements. This will communicate your efforts towards improving accessibility. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Example of simple policy\" class=\"example\" %} {:/} ACME Inc. is committed to ensuring that its website is accessible to people with disabilities. All the pages on our website will meet W3C WAI's [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](/TR/WCAG/) 2.1, Level AA conformance. Report any issues to . {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Reference standards {#reference} Reference specific standards in policy documents to ensure clear criteria for accessibility. The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) provides a set of accessibility standards that are commonly recognized by governments and organizations from around the world. These include: - **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** applies to all web content and applications. This includes content on mobile, television, and other delivery channels. The [WCAG Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}) provides more background. - **Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)** applies to websites that provide users the opportunity to generate content. For example, adding comments, posting to forums, or uploading images or videos. ATAG is also relevant if your organization provides tools, such as CMS's, for staff or customers to manage websites and content. The [ATAG Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/atag/\" | relative_url }}) provides more background. - **User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)** applies when additional plugins are provided to deliver additional content. Media players are a good example of this. UAAG also applies when custom controls are used to provide non-standard functionality. UAAG may also be relevant where mobile applications deliver web content as part of the application. It may also be relevant to the procurement process if your organization provides browsers for staff. The [UAAG Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/uaag/\" | relative_url }}) provides more background. ### Referencing Approaches As technologies and standards continually evolve, it is important to keep policies current. The text of policies that include accessibility requirements tend to quickly become outdated. This introduces gaps between current accessibility standards and older policies. Ideally, a policy would reference the W3C/WAI standards. It should also define a mechanism to transition to newer versions of the standards when they become available. [Referencing Guidelines and Other Technical Specifications]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/linking/\" | relative_url }}#trs) Explains options relating to referencing. ## Define conformance levels {#conformance} W3C WAI guidelines provide three levels of conformance: A, AA, and AAA. The generally accepted level of conformance in many countries is Level AA. It is critical for the success of your policy to select a conformance level you can realistically achieve. Once selected, specify what level of conformance is to be achieved for each referenced standard. ### Examples {#ex1} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Simple example of referencing WCAG\" class=\"example\" %} {:/} ACME Inc. seeks to make sure our website conforms to W3C WAI [WCAG](/TR/WCAG20/) 2.1 Level AA. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Example of reference to WCAG and ATAG\" class=\"example\" %} {:/} At ACME Inc. we seek to ensure all of our websites and web applications, conform to all Level AA success criteria of W3C WAI [WCAG 2.1](/TR/WCAG21/). This applies to both customer-facing and for internal use. We also aim to ensure that our authoring tools conform to all Level AA criteria of [ATAG](/TR/ATAG/). {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Define scope of policy {#scope} Clearly state the scope of your policy, and how it applies to different parts of the websites in scope. This includes third-party, legacy, and mobile content. It also applies to applications provided as part of these websites. Your policy may apply to websites internal to the organization, such as intranets, and to websites for external audiences. It also includes the tools used to create and to access your website. Note that broader policies may impact your scope considerations. For example, public websites and services could be different from access to the workplace. ### Examples {#ex2} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Simple example of content scope\" class=\"example\" %} {:/} This policy applies to all new, updated, and existing web content on http://www.acme.inc/ and all content provided internally at http://intranet.acme.inc/. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Set conformance milestones {#milestones} For all items in scope of your policy, define clear and measureable milestones, including dates, by which each will be met. If the policy is already achieved, then say when the content was last reviewed. Deadlines should be realistic but issues should not be left too long. In some cases, a phased approach might be appropriate. First, quickly fix significant accessibility barriers. Then implement fixes for other issues. You could do this as part of a planned maintenance update. Clearly outline any details of this type of approach in your policy. ### Examples {#ex3} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Simple example of conformance milestone\" class=\"example\" %} {:/} By February 1, 20XX, ACME Inc's web content will meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA conformance. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Example of staged conformance milestones\" class=\"example\" %} {:/} By November 1, 20XX, ACME Inc's websites will meet WCAG 2.1, Level A conformance. By May 1, 20XX web content will meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA conformance. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Example of supplier milestone\" class=\"example\" %} {:/} By June 1, 20XX, all vendors of content management systems (CMS) used by ACME Inc's should provide information regarding their plans for ATAG 2.0 conformance in future versions of their software. By June 1, 20XX ACME Inc. will preferentially purchase ATAG conformant authoring tools. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Consider third-party content {#thirdparty} Your accessibility policy needs to consider procured or syndicated third-party content. This is particularly relevant for third-party content that provides essential parts of a website. For example, this could include credit card payment services, video streaming channels, or online mapping services. Site owners are responsible for ensuring accessibility or for providing accessible alternatives. This is true even if site owners don't have full control over such content and services. For example, social media feeds may need to be monitored or moderated to ensure accessibility. See the WCAG 2.1 conformance requirement for [complete processes](/TR/WCAG21/#cc3) and the concept of [conforming alternate version](/TR/WCAG21/#conforming-alternate-versiondef) for more background. ### Examples {#ex4} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Example including third-party content scope\" class=\"example\" %} {:/} This policy applies to all web content produced or updated by ACME Inc. ACME Inc. will also ensure third-party content providers are aware of our web accessibility policy. ACME Inc. will also favor providers based on their accessibility conformance claims. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Define monitoring and review process {#monitor} Regularly review progress towards policy goals. Update the policy when there are changes to the timescale or when you meet milestones To maintain the target level of accessibility, specify a process and schedule to review content and tools in scope. Feedback from users who might find accessibility barriers can help you identify issues. Your policy should include information on how you will gather feedback. It should also include information how how your organization will handle and respond to feedback. ### Examples {#ex5} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Example simple review policy\" class=\"example\" %} {:/} ACME Inc. will review all area of the website every year. We will use the process described at [Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology](/TR/WCAG-EM/). Reviews are the responsibility of the ICT department. Accessibility checks will be incorporated into the publishing workflow for all new content. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Example of feedback policy\" class=\"example\" %} {:/} Each page of the website will include a link to a form allowing users to submit feedback on the site. We will compile and consider this information during the review process. We will respond to any feedback within 48 hours of submission. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Example policies {#examples} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Example of simple policy\" class=\"example\" %} {:/} ACME Inc. is committed to ensuring the accessibility of its web content to people with disabilities.

For example, how to implement the policy, or who or what departments are responsible, specific exclusions. An [example comprehensive policy]({{ \"/planning/org-policies/example/\" | relative_url }}) is provided. ## Policy template {#template} In the template below, the [hints] in brackets are sections for you to complete. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Example Policy Template\" class=\"example\" %} {:/} [Organization name] is committed to ensuring accessibility of its website and intranet to people with disabilities. New and updated web content produced by our organization will meet [link to standard] [version number], [level of conformance], by [compliance date]. Existing web content produced by our organization will meet our standard by [existing content compliance date]. Content provided for our site by third-party developers will meet [third-party content standard] [version number] by [third-party content compliance date]. This [does/does not] include user-generated content. We aim to ensure that our authoring tools and processes meet [authoring tools standard] [version number] by [authoring tools compliance date]. By [preferential purchasing date] we will preferentially purchase authoring tools that meet or exceed our web accessibility policy. We will review this policy [review period] on or before the [policy review date]. This policy was last reviewed on [last review date], by [reviewer]. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Next steps: Maintaining your policy {#maintain} Keep your policy accurate and up to date. Regularly review your policy if it includes milestones. This is also true if it references particular standards by version number. Reviews should check that milestones have been met. It should also check if changes are required due to new or updated standards. You may need to adjust your policy's scope if you have new content. You may also need to adjust the scope if you make significant changes to the structure of your website. Changes in authoring tools or processes may also need to be thought about. ## Longer term: Strategic planning {#strategic} An accessibility policy is one part of a broader strategic approach to accessibility. Making accessibility an integral part of your web development strategy is more cost effective and efficient than considering it in isolation. You can do several things to help your organization create more accessible websites as standard. [Planning and Managing Web Accessibility]({{ \"/planning-and-managing/\" | relative_url }}) outlines how to integrate accessibility throughout your web development. When you plan a redesign or updates, include accessibility from the start of the project. Accessibility is cheaper when tackled at the start of a project, rather than at the end. It will also take less time and resources to include accessibility from the get-go.",

My name is Shadi Abou-Zahra. I'm the Accessibility Strategy and Technology Specialist at W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium, and today I'd like to tell you about web accessibility. Web Accessibility [Shadi speaking] The Web is for many people an essential part of daily life. People in an Internet cafe At work. Someone in an office using a computer At home. Someone sitting in a sofa using a laptop And on the road. Someone using a mobile phone while walking Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the Web equally. [Shadi speaking] For example, somebody who cannot use their arms, and uses a mouthstick to type. Someone using a mouthstick to type Or someone who cannot hear well, and uses captions to watch videos. Someone using a hearing aid Or someone who cannot see well, and uses a screen reader to read aloud what's on the screen. Someone using a screen reader Accessibility has many benefits. [Shadi speaking] For example, captions benefit anyone in a loud or in a quiet environment. Someone watching a video with captions in an office And good color contrast works better when there is glare. Someone looking at a mobile phone with glare on the screen Also people with age-related impairments, such as reduced dexterity, benefit. Someone with tremors using a mouse with difficulty In fact, everyone has a better user experience with an improved layout and design. Two people smiling happily at a well-designed website A lot of accessibility can be built into the underlying code of websites and applications. [Shadi speaking] Web technologies from W3C, such as HTML, provide many accessibility features. HTML code of a web page For example, to provide textual descriptions for images, which are read aloud by screen readers and also used by search engines. Example code Also headings, labels, and other code supports accessibility and improves the quality overall. Example code Good authoring tools, such as wikis, content management systems, and code editors, help create accessible code - either automatically or with input from the author. Example authoring tool used to create web content Also web browsers, media players, and apps need to support accessibility features. Example web browser used to show web content W3C provides standards to help make the Web accessible, which are internationally recognized by governments and businesses. [Shadi speaking] Most well-known is the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - WCAG. WCAG is also ISO 40500, and adopted in the European standard called EN 301 549. It is built around four core principles: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - WCAG; ISO 40500; EN 301 549 First, Perceivable - for example, so people can see the content, or hear it. Someone typing on their tablet computer and listening to it with headphones Operable - for example, so people can use the computer by typing, or by voice. Someone speaking to their computer Understandable - for example, so people get clear and simple language. Two people looking confused at the computer screen with a dense website And Robust - so people can use different assistive technologies. Someone using screen magnification on a large computer screen Besides WCAG, W3C also provides the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines - ATAG, which defines requirements for code management systems, code editors, and other software. Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines - ATAG And the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines - UAAG, defines requirements for web browsers and media players. User Agent Accessibility Guidelines - UAAG There are over one billion people with disabilities, or about 15-20% of the population. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities defines that access to information, including the Web, as a human right. Most countries around the world have ratified this UN convention, and several have adopted binding policies too. Yet regardless of any laws and regulations, implementing the accessibility standards is essential for people with disabilities, and useful for all.

    "title": "How to Make Your Presentations Accessible to All",
    "text": "**Do you remember a time when people around you broke out in laughter, but you didn't hear the joke? Be careful not to leave out information for some people in your audience. For example, if you say \"you can read it on the slide\", you are probably excluding people who cannot see the slide.** {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"2\" title=\"Summary\" class=\"full\" %} {:/} This page helps you make your presentations, talks, meetings, and training accessible to everyone in your potential audience, including people with disabilities and others. Inclusive presentations have many benefits. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::options toc_levels=\"2\" /} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"start\" title=\"Page Contents\" class=\"full\" %} {:/} - TOC is created automatically. {:toc} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {% include_cached excol.html type=\"all\" %} {% include_cached excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"basic\" %} ## Basics (for organizers & speakers) {% include_cached excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Be open to diversity in your audience and any accessibility issues. Basically, be aware that some of your audience might not be able to: - **see** well or at all, - **hear** well or at all, - **move** well or at all, - **speak** well or at all, or - **understand** information presented in some ways well or at all. Organizers and speakers should do things like: - ensure the facility is accessible - speak clearly into the microphone - describe pertinent visuals - and other considerations listed on this page **Respect participant's needs** and be open for other accessibility issues. People might have accessibility needs that you didn't think of. For example: Someone might need to take breaks at set times for insulin injections. Someone with Tourette syndrome might randomly shout out during a session. Someone with a physical disability who cannot take notes might need to record the session. Often speakers won't know if participants have disabilities. For example, at a large conference where organizers didn't ask registrants. In some cases, you might know the accessibility needs of participants ahead of time. Even then something could change. For example, a new participant could join the training at the last minute. Or someone could develop accessibility needs before the training. Make your event and your presentations accessible so that you are prepared for such situations. {% include_cached excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include_cached excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"benefits\" %} ## Benefits (organizers & speakers) {% include_cached excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Presentations that are accessible to people with disabilities are also **inclusive** to many more audiences. For example, people with different learning styles and people who are not fluent in the language. Accessible presentations also have additional benefits to organizations and individuals. In this example situation, a live presentation with “slides” is recorded and later made available in an audio podcast: - The presenter describes the important visual information in the slides during the presentation. That provides the visual information during the presentation to people who are blind and to people who cannot see the slides well. Later, people listening to the podcast also get the visual information that was described, even though they don’t have video. - During the presentation, a professional captioner types what is being said as text. People who are deaf or hard of hearing read the captioning. It also helps people who understand written text better than spoken language. For example, people whose native language is different. Later, the live captioning output is used to develop a text transcript of the presentation. - That transcript is put online and it increases search engine optimization (SEO) for the presentation, the podcast, and the website. If you want to learn about more benefits of accessible media, see [Benefits to Organizations and Individuals, in Making Audio and Video Media Accessible]({{ \"/media/av/\" | relative_url }}#benefits) and [benefits of transcripts {% include_cached external.html %}](http://www.uiaccess.com/transcripts/transcripts_on_the_web.html). {% include_cached excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include_cached excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"arrange\" %} ## Planning the Event (organizers) {% include_cached excol.html type=\"middle\" %} ### Ask speakers and participants if they have accessibility requirements For example, include a question on registration forms for conferences, send an email to company-internal training participants, etc. Invite participants to include specific requests. For example, someone who is hard of hearing might request seating small discussion groups in a circle to make it easier to hear people talking. Or someone with low vision might ask to sit in the front row to see the screen better. ### Ensure the facility and area is accessible to speakers and participants For example, ensure the building entrance, meeting room, presentation stage, and bathrooms are accessible. (There are checklists online to help ensure a facility is accessible, such as [Accessibility Checklist for Existing Facilities {% include_cached external.html %}](http://uiaccess.com/facilities.html).) Provide accessibility information, such as the accessible routes between meeting rooms. Let speakers and participants check out the rooms in advance to suggest optimum positioning of the speaker, screen, seating, etc. ### Ensure adequate sound system, and arrange for microphones Often wireless lapel microphones are best so that speakers can move around. When the audience will be commenting or asking questions, provide microphones for them. ### Arrange for good visibility of the speakers and [interpreters](#terps){:.termref} Have good lighting on their face and upper body. Avoid distracting backgrounds, such as bright sunlight or flashing light. ### Arrange for assistive listening devices (ALD)(e.g., hearing loops), interpreters, and captioners, as needed *(Assistive listening devices ([ALDs](#ald){:.termref}), [interpreters](#terps){:.termref}, and ([captioners](#captions){:.termref}) are explained in the [Terminology](#terms) section.)* Work with participants and service providers to ensure that important details are taken care of. For example, a remote captioner can hear the audio clearly, an in-person captioner has the connections they need, and a screen is provided for participants to read the captions. Or, microphones and the presenter’s computer sound output is connected to the ALD system. ### Arrange for good Internet connection when needed Sometimes you might use the Internet for providing alternative formats of materials during the presentation. For example, allowing people using screen readers or other [assistive technologies](#terms){:.termref} to follow along with an online version of your displayed material. For remote [captioning](#captions){:.termref}, you will need a reliable connection that has enough bandwidth for transferring audio. ### Consider accessibility when planning the schedule Some people need more time to get from room to room. For example, because they move slowly, or because the accessible route is longer. Schedule sufficient breaks. People might need to take care of medical needs during breaks. Keep to the schedule as much as possible, and inform participants ahead of time of any changes. ### Give speakers accessibility requirements and guidance Tell speakers that you expect their material and presentations to be accessible to people with disabilities. Consider including accessibility requirements in any contracts. Consider including the link to this page (www.w3.org/WAI/training/accessible) in speaker guidelines, e-mails, web pages, etc. {% include_cached excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include_cached excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"material\" %} ## Provide Accessible Material and Media (organizers & speakers) {% include_cached excol.html type=\"middle\" %} ### Offer handouts, slides, and other material in accessible formats Word processing formats are often the most flexible to meet different people's needs. Participants might need material in alternative formats such as large print or braille. If they get the material in advance electronically, they may not need it in hard copy. ### Ensure slides, handouts, and other electronic material for participants is accessible For example, provide alternative text for images and mark up headings. HTML material, such as a conference website, should meet [WCAG]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}), at least Level AA. ([Preparing Slides and Projected Material](#slides) below has details for speakers. Some other resources are listed under [For More Information](#fyi) below.) ### Make media fully accessible — including audio and video used in sessions, and recordings of sessions provided afterwards For example, provide [captions](#captions){:.termref} _(called “intralingual subtitles” in some areas)_ and/or transcripts for audio, and provide audio description of visual information in videos. For guidance on creating accessible media, **see [Making Audio and Video Media Accessible]({{ \"/media/av/\" | relative_url }})**. {% include_cached excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include_cached excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"plan\" %} ## Planning Your Session (speakers) {% include_cached excol.html type=\"middle\" %} ### Provide material ahead of time, if requested Provide slides, handouts, and other material to participants, [interpreters](#terps){:.termref}, and [captioners](#captions){:.termref}, as needed. Make it accessible. (More about [providing accessible material](#material) is above.) ### Work with [interpreters](#terps){:.termref} and [captioners](#captions){:.termref} Give them material in advance. Explain acronyms, terms, names, etc. that you will use. Be available to answer questions. ### Caption audio, or otherwise make it available Ideally, any audio you use is also available in text, for example, videos are captioned. However, if [captioning](#captions){:.termref} is provided for your presentation, that can provide text of the audio. ### Consider activities Remember potential accessibility issues with any participant activities. For example, responding to questions, arranging sticky notes, small group projects, etc. ### Use multiple communication methods for different learning styles Some people can better understand verbal information. Other people can better understand pictures and diagrams. And others better understand text. {% include_cached excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include_cached excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"slides\" %} ## Preparing Slides and Projected Material (speakers) {% include_cached excol.html type=\"middle\" %} ### Make text and important visuals big enough to be read even from the back of the room. This includes graphics on slides, videos, posters, and other non-electronic material. ### Use an easy-to-read font face Simple fonts with consistent thickness are often easier to read from a distance. Fonts where parts of the letters are thin are harder to read. Avoid fancy fonts that are difficult to read. ### Use sufficient contrast between colors (\"luminance contrast\") This includes contrast between text and background colors, and between colors in graphs. There are guidelines for web pages that you can use to help determine sufficient contrast &mdash; even though the medium is different. See [Understanding contrast guidance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced) and [contrast evaluation tools](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced#resources). Use appropriate background and text colors. Some suggest when presenting in a light room, to display dark text on a light background. And when presenting in a darkened room, to display light text on a dark background. Ensure that the weight of text is sufficient (for example, bold). ### Consider how to use motion or animations This includes text or images flying in from the side. Will the motion make the information easier to understand, or is it unnecessary? Certain types of motion can be particularly distracting for some people, and can make some people ill. ### Make provided material accessible {#expres} If you are giving participants material, make it accessible. See [provide accessible material](#material) above. An [example of presentation material provided in both presentation format and web format (HTML and CSS)](http://www.w3.org/WAI/presentations/WCAG20_benefits/) is linked from the top of the page after \"The Benefits of WCAG 2 presentation is available in 3 formats:\". {% include_cached excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include_cached excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"during\" %} ## During the Presentation (speakers) {% include_cached excol.html type=\"middle\" %} ### Speak clearly And avoid speaking too fast, so participants and interpreters can better understand you and keep up. ### Use simple language Avoid or explain jargon, acronyms, and idioms. For example, expressions such as \"raising the bar\" can be interpreted literally by some people with cognitive disabilities and can be confusing. ### Give people time to process information Pause between topics. When you ask if anyone has questions, some people with cognitive disabilities will need extra time to form their thoughts into words. ### Be visible Be visible and in good light when you talk, so participants can see your face. This helps some people hear and understand better. Be careful not to face away from the audience to read projected material, particularly if you don't have a microphone. ### Use a microphone {#usemic} Some people might need the audio electronically, even in a small room. This includes people using [ALDs](#ald){:.termref} and remote [captioners](#captions){:.termref}. Note that if you ask \"Can everyone hear me OK?\" some people might be uncomfortable saying that they cannot. ### Ensure that all relevant sound is audible through the sound system. For example, if the audience doesn't have a microphone, repeat their questions and comments into your microphone before replying. ### Cover all displayed text {#visuals} Say all of the information that is on each slide. (This does not mean that you have to read the slide exactly as it is. It just means that you cover the visual information in what you say.) ### Describe pertinent parts of graphics, videos, and other visuals Describe them to the extent needed to understand the presentation. (You usually do not need to describe decorative images.) ### Describe other visual information For example, a speaker asks people to raise their hands if they make their websites fully accessible. The speaker should then describe the visual response: \"About half raised their hand\". {% include_cached excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include_cached excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"fyi\" %} ## For More Information (speakers & organizers) {% include_cached excol.html type=\"middle\" %} This web page addresses in-person sessions.

ALDs, hearing loops, induction loops : Assistive listening devices (ALDs), hearing loops, and induction loops amplify sound from the speaker's microphone for people who are hard of hearing. captions, captioner : _Captions (called “intralingual subtitles” in some areas)_ are a text version of speech and important non-speech audio. Live captioning in different areas is called different things, such as CART (Computer Aided Real–Time Captioning or Communication Access Realtime Translation), or real-time intralingual subtitling.A _captioner_ (or “live subtitler”) is a professional who provides what is being said verbatim so that people can read the text output.More information is in [Captions/Subtitles, in Making Audio and Video Media Accessible]({{ \"/media/av/captions/\" | relative_url }}). interpreters : In this resource, “interpreters” includes sign language interpreters, cued speech transliterators, and others.

Mijn naam is Shadi Abou-Zahra. Ik ben de Specialist voor Strategie en Technologie van Toegankelijkheid bij W3C, het World Wide Web Consortium, en vandaag wil ik u graag wat vertellen over toegankelijkheid van het web. Web-toegankelijkheid [Shadi praat] Het web is voor veel mensen een essentieel deel van het dagelijks leven. Mensen in een Internet-café Op het werk. Iemand in een kantoor gebruikt een computer Thuis. Iemand zit met een laptop op een bank En onderweg. Iemand gebruikt al lopend een mobiele telefoon Toegankelijkheid van het web betekent dat mensen met handicaps het web even goed kunnen gebruiken. [Shadi praat] Bijvoorbeeld, iemand die z'n armen niet kan gebruiken en een mondstokje gebruikt om te typen. Iemand gebruikt een mondstokje om te typen Of iemand die niet goed kan horen en ondertitels gebruikt om videos te bekijken. Iemand met een gehoorapparaat Of iemand die niet goed kan zien en een schermlezer gebruikt die hardop leest wat op het scherm staat. Iemand gebruikt een schermlezer Toegankelijkheid heeft vele voordelen. [Shadi praat] Bijvoorbeeld, ondertitels zijn nuttig in een luidruchtige of stille omgeving. Iemand bekijkt een video met ondertitels in een kantoor En een goed kleurcontrast werkt beter als er lichtinval is. Iemand kijkt naar een mobiele telefoon met weerkaatst licht op het scherm En ook mensen met ouderdomsgebreken, zoals minder handigheid, hebben er voordeel van. Iemand met een tremor die moeite heeft met het gebruik van een muis In feite heeft iedereen een betere gebruikers-ervaring met een verbeterd ontwerp en layout. Twee glimlachende mensen die blij zijn met een goed ontworpen website Veel toegankelijkheid kan in de onderliggende code van websites en applicaties ingebouwd worden. [Shadi praat] Web-technologieën van W3C, zoals HTML, bieden ondersteuning voor veel toegankelijkheids-eigenschappen. HTML-broncode van een web-pagina Bijvoorbeeld, eigenschappen om tekst aan te bieden als alternatief voor plaatjes, die hardop wordt gelezen door schermlezers en ook wordt gebruikt door zoekmachines. Voorbeeld van broncode Titels, labels en andere codes ondersteunen toegankelijkheid en verbeteren de algehele kwaliteit. Voorbeeld van broncode Goede schrijfhulpen, zoals wiki's, content-management-systemen en broncode-editors, helpen bij het maken van toegankelijke code, soms automatisch, soms met hulp van de schrijver. Voorbeeld van een schrijfhulp om tekst voor het Web te maken Webbrowsers, media-spelers en apps moeten de toegankelijkheids-eigenschappen ook ondersteunen. Voorbeeld van een webbrowser in gebruik om tekst weer te geven W3C biedt standaarden om het web toegankelijk te maken, die internationaal worden erkend door overheden en bedrijven. [Shadi praat] De bekendste is de Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - WCAG. WCAG is ook de ISO-standaard 40500, en opgenomen in de Europese standaard genaamd EN 301 549. Hij is opgebouwd rond vier centrale principes: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - WCAG; ISO 40500; EN 301 549 Om te beginnen Waarneembaar - bijvoorbeeld zodat mensen de inhoud kunnen zien of horen. Iemand typt op een tablet en luistert ernaar met een koptelefoon Bedienbaar - bijvoorbeeld zodat mensen de computer kunnen gebruiken door te typen of via spraak. Iemand die praat tegen zijn computer Begrijpelijk - bijvoorbeeld zodat mensen heldere en eenvoudige taal krijgen. Twee mensen kijken in verwarring naar een computerscherm met een onbegrijpelijke website En Robuust - zodat mensen verschillende hulpmiddelen kunnen gebruiken. Iemand gebruikt het vergrootglas op een groot computerscherm Naast WCAG biedt W3C ook de Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines - ATAG, die de vereisten definieert voor content-management-systemen, broncode-editors en andere programmatuur. Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines - ATAG En de User Agent Accessibility Guidelines - UAAG definieert de vereisten voor webbrowsers en media-spelers. User Agent Accessibility Guidelines - UAAG Er zijn meer dan een miljard mensen met handicaps, oftewel 15-20% van de bevolking. De VN-conventie inzake rechten van personen met een handicap definieert toegang tot informatie, inclusief het web, als een mensenrecht. De meeste landen in de wereld hebben deze VN-conventie bekrachtigd, en verscheidene hebben ook bindend beleid aangenomen. Maar ongeacht alle wetten en regels, toepassen van de toegankelijks-standaarden is essentieel voor mensen met handicaps, en nuttig voor iedereen.

Eu sou o Especialista em Tecnologia e Estratégia de acessibilidade do W3C, o, Consórcio World Wide Web e hoje eu gostaria de informá-lo sobre acessibilidade na Web. Acessibilidade Web [Shadi falando] Para muitas pessoas a Web é uma parte essencial do dia a dia. Pessoas em um cyber café No trabalho. Alguém em um escritório usando um computador Em Casa. Alguém sentado em um sofá usando um laptop E em viagens. Alguém usando um telefone celular enquanto caminhava Acessibilidade na Web significa que pessoas com deficiências podem usar a Web igualmente. [Shadi falando] Por exemplo, alguém que não pode usar os braços e usa um bastão de boca para digitar. Alguém usando um palito para digitar Ou alguém que não ouve bem e usa legendas para assistir a vídeos. Alguém usando um aparelho auditivo Ou alguém que não enxerga bem e utiliza um leitor de tela que lê em voz alta o que está na tela. Alguém usando um leitor de tela A acessibilidade possui muitos benefícios. [Shadi falando] Por exemplo, as legendas beneficiam qualquer um em ambientes silenciosos ou barulhentos. Alguém assistindo a um vídeo com legendas em um escritório E um bom contraste de cor funciona melhor quando há brilho. Alguém olhando para um celular com brilho na tela Pessoas com deficiências relativas à idade, tais como destreza reduzida, também beneficiam-se. Alguém com tremores usando um mouse com dificuldade Na verdade, com layout e design aprimorados, todos têm uma experiência de usuário melhor. Duas pessoas sorrindo alegremente em um site bem projetado Pode-se incorporar muita acessibilidade no código subjacente de sites e aplicativos. [Shadi falando] Tecnologias Web do W3C, tais como HTML, fornecem suporte para muitos recursos de acessibilidade. Código HTML de um site Por exemplo, recursos que fornecem alternativas de texto para imagens, que são lidas em voz alta por leitores de tela e também utilizadas pelos mecanismos de busca. Exemplo de código Também cabeçalhos, rótulos e outros códigos suportam a acessibilidade e melhoram a qualidade em geral. Exemplo de código Boas ferramentas de autoria, como wikis, sistemas de gerenciamento de conteúdo e editores de código, ajudam a criar um código acessível, tanto automaticamente ou com o input do autor. Exemplo de ferramenta de autoria usada para criar conteúdo da web Navegadores Web, players de mídia e aplicativos também precisam dar suporte a recursos de acessibilidade. Exemplo de navegador da web usado para mostrar o conteúdo da web O W3C fornece padrões para ajudar a tornar a Web acessível, reconhecidos internacionalmente por governos e empresas. [Shadi falando] Alguns dos mais conhecidos são as Diretrizes de Acessibilidade para Conteúdo Web - WCAG. As WCAG também são o padrão ISO 40500, e adotadas no padrão europeu denominado EN 301 549. Elas são fundamentadas em torno de quarto princípios: Diretrizes de Acessibilidade para Conteúdo Web - WCAG; ISO 40500; EN 301 549 Primeiramente Perceptível - por exemplo, para que as pessoas possam ver ou ouvir o conteúdo. Alguém escrevendo em um tablet e ouvindo com fones de ouvido. Operável – por exemplo, para que as pessoas possam utilizar o computador por meio de digitação ou da voz. Alguém falando com seu computador Compreensível – por exemplo, para que as pessoas contem com uma linguagem simples e clara. Duas pessoas parecendo confusas na tela do computador com um site denso E Robusto – para que as pessoas possam usar diferentes tecnologias assistivas. Alguém usando a ampliação de tela em uma tela de computador grande Além das WCAG, o W3C também fornece as Diretrizes de Acessibilidade para Ferramentas de Autoria - ATAG, que definem requerimentos para sistemas de gerenciamento de conteúdo, publicadores de código e outros softwares. Diretrizes de Acessibilidade para Ferramentas de Autoria - ATAG E as Diretrizes de Acessibilidade para Agente de Usuário - UAAG, que definem requerimentos para navegadores Web e players de mídia. Diretrizes de Acessibilidade para Agente de Usuário - UAAG Há mais de um bilhão de pessoas com deficiência ou cerca de 15-20% da população. A Convenção da ONU sobre Direitos das Pessoas com Deficiência define o acesso à informação, inclusive à Web, como um direito humano. A maior parte dos países em todo o mundo ratificou essa convenção da ONU, e vários também adotaram políticas vinculativas. Porém, independentemente de quaisquer leis e regulamentos, implementar os padrões de acessibilidade é essencial para pessoas com deficiência e útil para todos.

Всеобщая доступность, невзирая на ограничения здоровья, является непременным его условием Tim Berners-Lee, директор W3C и создатель Всемирной паутины Основная цель Всемирной сети – приносить пользу всем людям, вне зависимости от имеющегося оборудования или программного обеспечения, от языка общения, места проживания или возможностей здоровья. Если Интернет выполняет данные условия, он становится доступным для людей с различными слуховыми, двигательными, зрительными и познавательными возможностями. Влияние ограничений здоровья на развитие Всемирной паутины коренным образом меняется, ведь Интернет разрушает препятствия для общения и взаимодействия, с которыми люди сталкиваются в материальном мире. В то же время, если веб-сайты, онлайн-приложения, сетевые технологии или инструменты спроектированы неудачно, они могут создавать для людей преграды на пути к использованию Всемирной сети. **Доступность имеет принципиальное значение для разработчиков и организаций, которые стремятся создавать качественные веб-сайты и онлайн-приложения, но не лишать людей возможности пользоваться их продуктами и услугами.** ## Что представляет собой веб-доступность {#what} Веб-доступность предполагает проектирование и разработку веб-сайтов, приложений и технологических решений с учётом возможности их использования людьми с нарушениями здоровья. Иными словами, пользователи могут самостоятельно: - получать, толковать, искать информацию и общаться посредством сети Интернет - участвовать в работе Всемирной сети Веб-доступность охватывает все виды нарушений здоровья, которые влияют на возможность использования Всемирной паутины, включая: - Нарушения слуха - Нарушения познавательной деятельности - Неврологические нарушения - Нарушения физического развития - Нарушения речевой деятельности - Нарушения зрения Веб-доступность также отвечает интересам здоровых людей, в частности: - обладателей мобильных телефонов, «умных часов», телевизоров с технологией Smart TV и других устройств, которые характеризуются наличием малого экрана, специфических режимов ввода данных и т.п. - пожилых людей, испытывающих возрастные затруднения; - людей с «временной недееспособностью», обусловленной, к примеру сломанной рукой или потерей очков; - людей в условиях «ситуационных ограничений», таких как яркий солнечный свет или окружающая обстановка, запрещающая прослушивание аудиозаписей; - пользователей, ограниченных низкоскоростным соединением, лимитированным или дорогостоящим Интернет-трафиком.

Крайне важно, чтобы Всемирная сеть обеспечивала равный доступ и одинаковые возможности людям с различными способностями. Конвенция ООН о правах инвалидов ([КПИ](https://www.un.org/ru/documents/decl_conv/conventions/disability.shtml)) причисляет доступ к информационным и коммуникационным технологиям, включая Интернет, к основным правам и свободам человека. Всемирная паутина предоставляет большому количеству людей с нарушениями здоровья беспрецедентный доступ к информации и возможностям взаимодействия. Иначе говоря, препятствия на пути к печатным, звуковым и наглядным материалам могут эффективно преодолеваться посредством использования Интернет-технологий. Веб-доступность способствует социальной интеграции людей с ограниченными возможностями здоровья, равно как и других категорий лиц, а именно: - Пожилых людей - Жителей отдалённых территорий - Лиц, проживающих в развивающихся странах **Веские доводы относительно преимуществ веб-доступности приводятся и для бизнеса.** Как показано в предыдущем разделе, доступное проектирование веб-технологий повышает удобство их применения и степень удовлетворённости пользователя, особенно с учётом самых различных условий, в случаях применения разнообразных устройств, в отношении пожилых пользователей. Веб-доступность может оказать содействие в усилении вашего бренда, стимулировании инноваций и увеличении присутствия вашей компании на рынке.

Стандарты играют жизненно важную роль в определении требований доступности для каждого из этих компонентов. Некоторые требования доступности легко выполнить, но понимание основ того, как люди с ограниченными возможностями используют Интернет, помогает реализовать их более эффективно и действенно. Некоторые аспекты доступности требуют дополнительных технических навыков или глубоких знаний о том, как люди используют Интернет.

Примеры: - Короткие эквиваленты изображений, включая значки, кнопки и графику - Описание данных, представленных на графиках, диаграммах и иллюстрациях - Краткие описания нетекстового контента, такого как аудио и видео файлы - Ярлыки для элементов управления, ввода и других компонентов пользовательского интерфейса Текстовые версии описывают цель изображения или функции для обеспечения эквивалентного пользовательского взаимодействия. Например, подходящей текстовой альтернативой для кнопки поиска будет \"*поиск*\", а не \"*увеличительная линза*\". Текстовые версии могут быть представлены различными способами. Например, они могут зачитываться вслух пользователям, которые не могут видеть экран или испытывают трудности при чтении, при значительном увеличении размеров текста или отображении его на устройствах Брайля. Текстовые версии служат метками элементов управления и функций, помогая управлять контентом с клавиатуры или голосом (голосовой ввод).

Стандарты консорциума W3C называются Рекомендациями (W3C Recommendations). Все стандарты W3C проходят проверку на предмет поддержки доступности веб-контента, которая осуществляется Рабочей Группой по Архитектурам Доступных Платформ ([APA (на английском)]({{ \"/about/groups/apawg/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}). Представленные далее стандарты W3C и примечания Рабочей Группы самым непосредственным образом связаны с обеспечением веб-доступности. ## Рекомендации по обеспечению веб-доступности {#guidelines} [В разделе Основные компоненты веб-доступности (на английском)]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} раскрывается информация о влиянии тесной взаимосвязи отдельных элементов разработки контента и взаимодействия с Интернет-пользователями на обеспечение веб-доступности, а также описаны способы применения рекомендаций WAI (WCAG, ATAG, UAAG). ### Руководство по обеспечению доступности веб-контента (WCAG) {#wcag} Веб-«контент», как правило, подразумевает информацию, размещённую на Интернет-странице или в онлайн-приложении, в том числе: * обычную информацию, а именно, текстовые, графические и звуковые материалы; * коды или разметки, определяющие структуру данных, их представление и т.п. Руководство по обеспечению доступности веб-контента (WCAG) применяется к динамическому содержимому, мультимедийным материалам, “мобильному” контенту и т.д. Указания WCAG могут также распространяться на несетевые информационные и коммуникационные технологии, согласно описанию [WCAG2ICT (на английском)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/non-web-ict/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"}. Информация о Руководстве WCAG: - [Обзор WCAG (на английском)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} - [Общая информация о WCAG 2.1 (на английском)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} - [Практическое руководство по WCAG 2 (Краткий справочник)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) - [Стандарт WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) - [Стандарт WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) ### Руководство по доступности средств разработки авторского контента (ATAG) {#atag} Средства по разработке авторского контента – это программные средства и сервисы, используемые «авторами» (разработчиками, дизайнерами, программистами и т.д.) для создания информационного наполнения Интернет-сайта. К подобным сервисам относятся HTML-редакторы, системы управления контентом (CMS), а также веб-сайты, позволяющие пользователям добавлять информационное содержимое, например блоги и социальные сети.

Меня зовут Шади Абу-Зара. Я специалист по стратегии доступности и технологиям в W3C, Всемирного веб консорциума, и сегодня я хотел бы рассказать вам о веб-доступности. Веб-доступность [Шади говорит] Для многих Интернет является неотъемлемой частью повседневной жизни. Люди в интернет-кафе На работе. Человек в офисе работает на компьютере Дома. Человек сидит на диване с ноутбуком И в дороге. Человек на ходу смотрит карту на мобильном телефоне Веб-доступность означает, что люди с ограниченными возможностями могут использовать Интернет наравне с другими. [Шади говорит] Например, те, кто не может использовать руки, набирают текст при помощи специального мундштука, который держат во рту. Человек использует мундштук для ввода Или те, кто плохо слышит, читают титры во время просмотра видео. Человек со слуховым аппаратом смотрит в монитор А те, кто плохо видит или не видит вовсе, используют программу экранного чтения, чтобы воспринимать на слух то, что на написано на экране. Человек использует программу чтения экрана Доступность дает много преимуществ. [Шади говорит] Например, субтитры полезны всем в слишком шумном или, напротив, в тихом окружении. Человек смотрит видео с титрами в офисе Достаточный цветовой контраст помогает видеть при ярком свете. Человек смотрит на мобильный телефон с бликами на экране Доступность помогает пожилым, у которых ограничена подвижность рук. Пожилой человек с дрожащей рукой с трудом пользуется мышью На самом деле, всем приятно работать с сайтом с качественной версткой и дизайном. Два человека улыбаются, глядя на сайт с удобным дизайном Доступность может быть улучшена в код веб-сайтов и приложений. [Шади говорит] Веб-технологии W3C, такие как HTML, предоставляют различные возможности по улучшению доступности. HTML-код веб-страницы Например, текстовые описания для изображений, которые программы экранного чтения зачитывают вслух, а также их используют поисковые системы. Пример кода Заголовки, метки и другой код поддерживают доступность и улучшают качество в целом. Пример кода Качественные средства разработки, такие как вики, системы управления контентом и редакторы кода, помогают создавать доступный код – автоматически или вручную. Пример инструмента разработки, используемого для создания веб-контента Веб-браузеры, мультимедийные проигрыватели и приложения должны поддерживать специальные возможности доступности. Пример веб-браузера, используемого для отображения веб-контента W3C разрабатывает стандарты, помогающие сделать Интернет доступным, которые признаны правительствами и бизнесом во всем мире. [Шади говорит] Наиболее известным является Руководство по доступности веб-контента - WCAG. WCAG также является стандартом ISO 40500, и принятым европейским стандартом EN 301 549. Он основан на четырех основных принципах: Правила доступности веб-контента - WCAG; ISO 40500; EN 301 549 Первый принцип – восприятие. Пользователи могут видеть или слышать контент. Человек печатает на планшетном компьютере и слушает в наушниках Управляемость. Пользователи могут управлять компьютером с клавиатуры или голосом. Человек говорит с компьютером Понятность. Контент должен быть на простом и понятном языке. Два озадаченных человека смотрят на экран с перенасыщенным контентом веб-сайтом И Надежность. Пользователи могут использовать различные ассистивные технологии. Человек использует увеличение на большом экране компьютера Помимо WCAG, W3C также предоставляет Руководство по доступности для инструментов разработки контента - ATAG, которое определяет требования к системам управления контентом, редакторам кода и другому программному обеспечению. Руководство по доступности инструментов разработки - ATAG А в Руководстве по доступности пользовательских программ (UAAG) определены требования к веб-браузерам и медиапроигрывателям. Руководство по доступности пользовательских программ - UAAG В мире насчитывается более миллиарда людей с ограниченными возможностями, что составляет 15-20% населения. Конвенция ООН о правах инвалидов утверждает, что доступ к информации, включая доступ к Интернету, является правом человека. Большинство стран мира ратифицировали эту конвенцию ООН, а некоторые также разработали обязательную политику. Тем не менее, вне зависимости от законов и нормативных актов, внедрение стандартов доступности крайне важно для людей с ограниченными возможностями и полезно для всех.

When the link role is used on elements that do not behave as links, failing this rule might not mean that the success criteria are failed. ## Accessibility Support - There are assistive technologies that do not support using the `title` attribute for an [accessible name][], or in which this feature can be disabled. - For `area` elements that have an `href` attribute, but are not nested inside a `map` element, there are differences between browsers and assistive technology on if the `area` is [included in the accessibility tree][]. - Implementation of [Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][] varies from one browser or assistive technology to another. Depending on this, some elements can have a [semantic role][] of `link` and fail this rule with some technology but users of other technologies would not experience any accessibility issue. ## Background - [Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.4: Link Purpose (In Context)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context) - [ARIA7: Using aria-labelledby for link purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA7) - [ARIA8: Using aria-label for link purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA8) - [Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value) - [F89: Failure of Success Criteria 2.4.4, 2.4.9 and 4.1.2 due to not providing an accessible name for an image which is the only content in a link](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/failures/F89) ## Test Cases ### Passed #### Passed Example 1 This `a` element has an [accessible name][] from its content. ```html Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) ``` #### Passed Example 2 This `div` element has an [explicit semantic role](#explicit-role) of `link` and an [accessible name][] from its content. ```html Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) ``` #### Passed Example 3 This `button` element has an [explicit semantic role](#explicit-role) of `link` and an [accessible name][] from its content. ```html Click me for WAI! ``` #### Passed Example 4 This `a` element has an [accessible name][] via `aria-label` ```html ``` #### Passed Example 5 This `a` element has an [accessible name][] via `title`. ```html ``` #### Passed Example 6 This `a` element has an [accessible name][] from its content via the `title` on the `img` element. ```html ``` #### Passed Example 7 This `a` element has an [accessible name][] from its content. ```html Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) ``` #### Passed Example 8 This `a` element has an [accessible name][] from its content via `aria-labelledby` on the `img` element. ```html Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) ``` #### Passed Example 9 This `a` element placed off screen has an [accessible name][] from its content. ```html Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) ``` #### Passed Example 10 This `area` element has a [semantic role][] of `link` and an [accessible name][] via `alt`. ```html ``` ### Failed #### Failed Example 1 This `a` element has an empty [accessible name][]. ```html ``` #### Failed Example 2 This `a` element with an image has an empty [accessible name][].

Relate this to the structure of menus, in particular using lists and list items. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * explain how assistive technologies process structural HTML elements, such as lists, sub-lists, and list items, and communicate to people with disabilities these structures and their relationship to one another * describe different types of menus such as vertical, horizontal, breadcrumb trails, and application menus * identify menus using the HTML element `nav` and headings when necessary * write markup of menus as lists, sub-lists, and list items, for example using the HTML elements `ul`, `ol`, and `li` * write code that allows operation of menu functionality using keyboard only, voice interaction, and other input devices * write code for menus to display where expected according to their function and purpose #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Show examples of the HTML5 element `nav` to mark up a region as navigational. An example of how to use this element is provided in the WAI tutorials on [Identify menus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/structure/#identify-menus). * Refer back to the HTML elements `ul`, `ol`, and `li` taught in the previous module. Explain that they serve to structure and organize lists and list items. Examples of how to use these elements within a menu structure are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Menu representation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/structure/#menu-representation). * Provide examples of labels for menu items. Mention that these labels can be either text or graphics with their corresponding alternative texts within the HTML element `a`. Emphasize that people with cognitive disabilities and people using screen readers rely on labels to identify the purpose of each of the menu items. For examples of how to provide descriptive link texts, see technique [G91: Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G91.html). #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practical &mdash; Students identify the regions of the page that contain the menus and mark them up using navigation regions and headings as appropriate.

Explain how to convey visible and hidden states of submenu items using WAI-ARIA to make them usable by all users. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * write markup to convey the hierarchical relationship between a menu item and its submenus using nested lists and list items * write markup for items that contain submenu items using the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-haspopup` * write code for fly-out menus that support different input devices, including keyboard only and voice interaction * write code to convey visible and hidden states of menu items using the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-expanded`, and updating related labels accordingly * describe related requirements for designers to ensure that fly-out menus can be used effectively in different situations, such as using screen magnification and voice interaction #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Show examples of menus that contain submenu items. Explain that the layer with the submenu items needs to be marked up as a nested list, and that each of the submenu items needs to be marked up as a list item. An example of the structure of menu and submenu items is provided in the WAI tutorials on [Indicate submenus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/#indicate-submenus). * Explain the use of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-haspopup` to mark up the presence of submenu items. Indicate that this attribute should be present in the original HTML markup. An example of how to use the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-haspopup` is provided in the WAI tutorials on [Indicate submenus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/#indicate-submenus). * Show examples of different ways to interact with fly-out menus, such as using the mouse, keyboard, and voice interaction. Examples of how to make functionality of fly-out menus available to all users are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Fly-Out functionality](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/#fly-out-functionality). * Explain what the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-expanded` conveys: if the submenu items are visible or hidden. Explain that the attribute needs to be present in the original HTML markup. Examples of how to use the `aria-expanded` attribute are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Indicate submenus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/flyout/#indicate-submenus). #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practical &mdash; Give students a visual structure of menu and submenu items and ask students to use the appropriate markup to convey that structure. Assess how students use nested lists and list items to programmatically convey the visual structure of menu and submenu items. * Practical &mdash; Give students a list of menu and submenu items and ask students to use the `aria-haspopup` attribute where necessary. Assess how students mark up the presence of submenu items. * Practical &mdash; Give students a fly-out menu and ask students to make it operable with mouse and keyboard. Assess how students implement functionality of fly-out menus that is usable with mouse and keyboard. * Practical &mdash; Give students a list of menu and submenu items that dynamically show and hide based on user input and ask students to code these dynamic changes. Assess how students use the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-expanded` in the markup as well as icons and other visual indication of the state of the submenu items. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: Application Menus {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Show examples of specific scenarios where application menus can be used. Application menus are commonly used in rich applications, which are further discussed in [Module 7 Rich Applications](/curricula/developer-modules/rich-applications). Explain the uses of additional WAI-ARIA roles and properties to mark up application menus. Refer to coding techniques to make application menus operable using various input devices, including keyboard only. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * identify situations in which it is appropriate to use application menus, such as for web applications, and explain the potential accessibility challenges of using application menus, including defining the appropriate keyboard commands for operating such menus * write markup for application menus using the WAI-ARIA property `role=\"menubar\"` * write markup for individual menu items using the WAI-ARIA property `role=\"menuitem\"` * write markup for application menu items containing submenus using the WAI-ARIA property `role=\"menu\"` * write code for application menus using the HTML element `tabindex` so that they can receive keyboard focus * write code that supports functionality of application menus using keyboard and other input devices #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Show examples of different types of menus in web applications. Emphasize that navigational menus require specific (desktop-like) keyboard interactions that are different from the tab key used in websites. Explain that additional markup is necessary for assistive technologies to render these menus adequately. Examples of how to code application menus are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Additional markup](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/application-menus/#additional-markup). * Show examples of how an application menu is operated using the keyboard. Explain that additional functionality needs to be added via scripts so that keyboard patterns resemble those of a desktop menu. Examples of how to code application menus so that they can be operable by keyboard are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Functionality](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/application-menus/#functionality) and [Keyboard behavior](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/application-menus/#keyboard-behavior). #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practical &mdash; Give students an application menu and ask students to mark it up using the required WAI-ARIA properties. Assess students' knowledge of accessible markup for application menus. * Practical &mdash; Give students an application menu and ask students to provide keyboard functionality.

This rule is not relevant for desktop browsers, nor for most modern mobile browsers. Only users with older mobile browsers can experience issues tested by this rule. ## Background - [Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.4: Resize text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/resize-text) - [HTML Specification - The `meta` element][meta] - [The initial-scale, minimum-scale, and maximum-scale properties][maximum-scale] - [The user-scalable property][user-scalable] ## Test Cases ### Passed #### Passed Example 1 This viewport `meta` element does not prevent user scaling because it does not specify the `maximum-scale` and `user-scalable` values. ```html Simple page showing random text Lorem ipsum ``` #### Passed Example 2 This viewport `meta` element does not prevent user scaling because it has `user-scalable` set to `yes`. ```html Simple page showing random text Lorem ipsum ``` #### Passed Example 3 This viewport `meta` element allows users to scale content up to 600% because it has `maximum-scale` set to 6.0. ```html Simple page showing random text Lorem ipsum ``` #### Passed Example 4 This viewport `meta` element does not prevent user scaling because it does not specify the `maximum-scale` and `user-scalable` values. ```html Simple page showing random text Lorem ipsum ``` #### Passed Example 5 This viewport `meta` element does not prevent user scaling because it has `maximum-scale` set to -1 which results in this value being dropped. ```html Simple page showing random text Lorem ipsum ``` ### Failed #### Failed Example 1 This viewport `meta` element prevents user scaling because it has `user-scalable` set to `no`. ```html Simple page showing random text Lorem ipsum ``` #### Failed Example 2 This viewport `meta` element prevents users to scale content up to 200% because it has `maximum-scale` set to 1.5. ```html Simple page showing random text Lorem ipsum ``` #### Failed Example 3 This viewport `meta` element prevents users to scale content up to 200% because it has `maximum-scale` set to 1.0. ```html Simple page showing random text Lorem ipsum ``` #### Failed Example 4 This viewport `meta` element prevents users to scale content up to 200% because it has `maximum-scale` set to `yes` which translates to 1.0. ```html Simple page showing random text Lorem ipsum ``` ### Inapplicable #### Inapplicable Example 1 There is no viewport `meta` element. ```html Simple page showing random text Lorem ipsum ``` #### Inapplicable Example 2 This viewport `meta` element does not have a `content` attribute. ```html Simple page showing random text Lorem ipsum ``` ## Glossary {% include_relative glossary/outcome.md %} {% include_relative glossary/visible.md %} ## Acknowledgements This rule was written in the [ACT Rules community group](https://w3.org/community/act-r/), with the support of the EU-funded [WAI-Tools Project](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/projects/wai-tools/). ### Authors - [Audrey Maniez](https://github.com/audreymaniez) - [Jey Nandakumar](https://github.com/jkodu) ## Changelog This is the first version of this ACT rule.

Todos los requisitos (criterios de conformidad) de la versión 2.0 están incluidos en 2.1. Los criterios de conformidad 2.0 son exactamente iguales (literalmente) en 2.1. WCAG proporciona 17 criterios de conformidad adicionales que hay que tener en cuenta: - [Accesibilidad Móvil en el W3C]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/mobile/es\" | relative_url }}) - Personas con baja visión - [Personas con discapacidades cognitivas y del aprendizaje (en Inglés)]({{ \"/cognitive/\" | relative_url }}){: hreflang=\"en\"} ## Pauta 1.3 Adaptable Cree contenido que pueda presentarse en diferentes formas (por ejemplo, con una disposición más simple) sin perder información ni estructura. ### 1.3.4 Orientación (AA) El contenido no restringe su vista y operación a una única orientación de pantalla, como por ejemplo retrato o paisaje, salvo que una orientación específica sea esencial. Un cómico con parálisis cerebral que usa una silla de ruedas: Problema:No puedo rotar mi tableta, está fijada a la silla de ruedas. Funciona bien:La aplicación funciona tanto si mi tableta está fijada de forma horizontal como vertical. Comprender la Orientación ### 1.3.5 Identificación del Propósito de Entrada (AA) El propósito de cada campo de entrada que recoge información sobre el usuario puede ser determinado por software cuando: El campo de entrada sirve a un propósito identificado en los propósitos de entrada de los componentes de la interfaz de usuario; y El contenido se implementa usando tecnologías con soporte para identificar el significado esperado de los datos de entrada en formularios. Un auxiliar de supermercado con dislexia y discalculia: Problema:Mi dirección es muy complicada. Tiene muchos números y palabras largas. Me resulta difícil teclearlo todo sin cometer errores. Funciona bien:Me encantan los sitios web que automáticamente rellenan todo eso por mí. De esta forma, no tengo que esforzarme tanto para asegurar que los números y las palabras están bien. Nota: Esto funciona porque los campos utilizan autocompletado. Comprender la Identificación del Propósito de Entrada ### 1.3.6 Identificación del Propósito (AAA) En contenido implementado con lenguajes de marcado, el propósito de los componentes de la interfaz de usuario, iconos y regiones puede determinarse por software. Un jugador con discapacidad para procesar el lenguaje: Problema:Tengo un programa que cambia las palabras de la navegación por símbolos. No funciona con todos los sitios web. Funciona bien:Funciona bastante bien con algunos sitios web. Comprender la Identificación del Propósito ## Pauta 1.4 Distinguible Facilite que los usuarios puedan ver y oír el contenido incluyendo la separación entre el primer plano y el fondo. ### 1.4.10 Reajuste (AA) El contenido se puede presentar sin perder información ni funcionalidad, y sin necesidad de desplazamiento en dos dimensiones, para: Contenido en desplazamiento vertical con una anchura equivalente a 320 píxeles en CSS; Contenido en desplazamiento horizontal con una altura equivalente a 256 píxeles en CSS; Excepto para aquellas partes del contenido que debido a su uso o significado requieran desplazamiento bidimensional. Un padre con baja visión – 20/400: Problema:Es casi imposible leer el texto si tengo que desplazarme de derecha a izquierda con cada línea. Me siento desorientado y pierdo la posición. Hace que sea difícil entender lo que estoy leyendo. Funciona bien:Aumento el tamaño del texto al 400% y se reajusta dentro de la anchura de la ventana. Puedo leerlo fácilmente sin necesidad de desplazarme adelante y atrás. Comprender el Reajuste ### 1.4.11 Contraste no Textual (AA) La presentación visual de los siguientes elementos tiene un ratio de contraste de al menos 3:1 con respecto a los colores adyacentes: Componentes de la interfaz de usuario Información visual necesaria para identificar los componentes de la interfaz de usuario y los estados, excepto aquellos componentes inactivos o cuya apariencia sea determinada por el agente de usuario y no modificada por el autor; Objetos gráficos Partes de gráficos necesarias para comprender el contenido, excepto cuando una presentación particular de los gráficos sea esencial para la información transmitida. Un jubilado con poca sensibilidad al contraste: Problema:No pude usar el formulario de pedidos, no había cajas de texto. Después de una larga llamada con el servicio de atención al cliente, supe que las cajas de texto tenían un borde muy claro que yo no podía ver. Funciona bien:Puedo ver los iconos, botones y todo lo demás fácilmente, incluso bajo la luz del sol. Comprender el Contraste no Textual ### 1.4.12 Espaciado de Texto (AA) En contenido implementado con lenguajes de marcado que soporten las propiedades de estilo del texto siguientes no se produce ninguna pérdida de contenido o funcionalidad al ajustar todas estas propiedades y sin cambiar ninguna otra propiedad de estilo: Altura de la línea hasta al menos 1,5 veces el tamaño de la fuente; Espacio tras párrafo hasta al menos 2 veces el tamaño de la fuente; Espacio entre letras (tracking) hasta al menos 0,12 veces el tamaño de la fuente; Espacio entre palabras hasta al menos 0,16 veces el tamaño de la fuente. Excepción: Los lenguajes humanos y el código que no usen una o más de estas propiedades en forma escrita pueden cumplir usando solamente las propiedades que existan para esa combinación de lenguaje y código. Un estudiante con dislexia: y un jubilado con baja visión: Problema:La mayor parte del texto es difícil de leer. Está tan amontonado que no puedo concentrarme. Solamente aumentando el espacio entre líneas ya noto una diferencia. Cuando estoy muy cansado, también aumento el espacio entre palabras. Funciona bien:De acuerdo, sé que soy un poco raro, pero he creado una hoja de estilos que establece el espaciado de texto adecuado para mí. Es un alivio cuando los sitios web funcionan con mi CSS. Comprender el Espaciado de Texto ### 1.4.13 Contenido en Puntero Flotante o en Foco (AA) Si mover y alejar el puntero o el foco del teclado con respecto a un elemento resulta en contenido adicional que se muestra y después se oculta, entonces lo siguiente debe ser cierto: Descartable Debe existir un mecanismo para descartar el contenido adicional sin mover el puntero o el foco del teclado, salvo que el contenido adicional informe acerca de un error de entrada o no oculte ni sustituya otro contenido; Superponible Si cuando el puntero flota sobre un elemento se muestra contenido adicional, entonces el puntero debe poder moverse sobre este contenido adicional sin que desaparezca; Persistente El contenido adicional debe permanecer visible hasta que el puntero o el foco lo abandonen, el usuario lo descarte o la información ya no sea válida. Excepción: la presentación visual del contenido adicional es controlada por el agente de usuario y no es modificada por el autor. Un profesor con baja visión que usa un programa de magnificación de pantalla: Problema:Estaba moviendo el ratón para seguir lo que veía en el sitio web. Me ayuda a concentrarme. De repente, ¡bum!, apareció un cuadro pequeño. Cubría lo que estaba intentando leer y no pude hacerlo desaparecer. Funciona bien:Posé el puntero sobre una palabra y se abrió un cuadro con su definición, pero se encontraba prácticamente fuera de la pantalla debido a mi magnificación. Moví el puntero del ratón hasta el cuadro de definición magnificado y me desplacé por éste, que permaneció visible y de esta forma pude leerlo. Comprender Contenido en Puntero Flotante o en Foco ## Pauta 2.1 Accesible por Teclado Proporcione acceso a toda la funcionalidad mediante el teclado. ### 2.1.4 Atajos de Teclado (A) Si el contenido implementa un atajo de teclado que solamente hace uso de letras (tanto mayúsculas como minúsculas), signos de puntuación, números o símbolos, entonces al menos una de las siguientes condiciones debe ser cierta: Desactivación Existe un mecanismo para desactivar el atajo de teclado; Modificación Existe un mecanismo que modifica el atajo para usar una o más teclas de caracteres no imprimibles (por ejemplo Ctrl, Alt, etc) Activo solamente en foco El atajo de teclado perteneciente a un componente de la interfaz de usuario solamente está activo cuando dicho componente tiene el foco. Un periodista con trastorno musculoesquelético que usa un programa de reconocimiento de voz: Problema:Usando mi aplicación de correo electrónico, borraba los mensajes en lugar de abrirlos. Nota: Había un atajo de teclado para borrar los mensajes que se activaba por algo que él estaba diciendo y no había manera de desactivarlo. Funciona bien:En mi aplicación de hojas de cálculo puedo desactivar o modificar los atajos de teclado. Comprender los Atajos de Teclado ## Pauta 2.2 Tiempo Suficiente Proporcione a los usuarios tiempo suficiente para leer y usar el contenido. ### 2.2.6 Límites Temporales (AAA) Los usuarios son informados de la duración del periodo de inactividad que podría provocar una pérdida de datos, salvo que los datos se mantengan durante más de 20 horas desde que el usuario no realiza acciones. Un auxiliar de supervisión en un colegio con discapacidad cognitiva: Problema:Estaba seleccionando los beneficios de los empleados y comparando diferentes planes. Cuando volví para seleccionar el plan de salud, la sesión caducó y perdí toda la información que había introducido. Funciona bien:Al iniciar la aplicación de beneficios de los empleados, fui informado de cuántos minutos disponía para rellenar los formularios. Comprender los Límites Temporales ## Pauta 2.3 Convulsiones y Reacciones Físicas No diseñe contenido de una forma que sea conocida por causar convulsiones o reacciones físicas. ### 2.3.3 Interacciones Animadas (AAA) Las animaciones activadas por alguna interacción pueden desactivarse, salvo que la animación sea esencial para la funcionalidad o la información transmitida. Un artista con trastorno vestibular: Problema:En la aplicación de impuestos en línea, según muevo el ratón o el cursor a diferentes campos, un bocadillo con el balance actual me sigue por toda la pantalla. Me provoca mareos y náuseas. Funciona bien:Me alegro de contar con una opción para desactivar todas las animaciones. Comprender las Interacciones Animadas ## Pauta 2.5 Modalidades de Entrada Facilite que los usuarios puedan operar la funcionalidad a través de diferentes entradas además del teclado. ### 2.5.1 Gestos del Puntero (A) Toda funcionalidad que para su operación use gestos basados en múltiples puntos o recorridos puede ser operada con un puntero sencillo sin gestos basados en recorridos, salvo que los gestos basados en múltiples puntos o recorridos sean esenciales. Un cómico con parálisis cerebral que tiene movimiento limitado en los dedos: Problema:No puedo mover mis dedos así. Necesito otro método para ampliar el mapa. Funciona bien:Es bueno que haya botones para ampliar y reducir. Comprender los Gestos del Puntero ### 2.5.2 Cancelación del Puntero (A) Aquella funcionalidad que pueda operarse con un puntero sencillo debe cumplir al menos una de las siguientes condiciones: Sin evento “down” El evento “down” del puntero no se usa para ejecutar ninguna parte de la funcionalidad; Abortar o deshacer La función se completa con el evento “up”, y existe un mecanismo para abortar la función antes de que sea completada o para deshacerla después de completada; Inversión en “up” El evento “up” invierte cualquier resultado del evento “down” precedente; Esencial Es esencial que la función se complete con el evento “down”. Un político con discapacidad motora y baja visión: Problema:Quise pulsar el botón de “Silenciar” pero accidentalmente toqué el de “Terminar llamada”. Se cortó inmediatamente. Funciona bien:En otra aplicación de videoconferencias, si accidentalmente toco el botón de “Terminar llamada”, puedo deslizar el dedo fuera de ese botón y así no se termina la llamada. Comprender la Cancelación del Puntero ### 2.5.3 Etiqueta en el Nombre (A) En los componentes de la interfaz de usuario con etiquetas que incluyan texto o imágenes de texto, el nombre contiene el texto que se presenta visualmente. Un periodista con trastorno musculoesquelético que usa un programa de reconocimiento de voz: Problema:Entendió casi todos mis comandos de voz hasta que llegué al botón de enviar. Estuve repitiendo “enviar” pero no funcionó. Nota: visualmente, estaba etiquetado como “Enviar” pero el “nombre” en el código era “Entregar”. Habría funcionado si el nombre hubiera empezado con “Enviar”. Comprender la Etiqueta en el Nombre ### 2.5.4 Actuación del Movimiento (A) La funcionalidad que puede operarse a través del movimiento del dispositivo o del usuario también puede operarse a través de componentes de la interfaz de usuario y la respuesta al movimiento puede desactivarse para evitar actuaciones accidentales, excepto cuando: Interfaz soportada El movimiento se usa para operar la funcionalidad a través de una interfaz con soporte para la accesibilidad; Esencial El movimiento es esencial para la función y cualquier otra forma invalidaría la actividad. Un cómico con parálisis cerebral que usa silla de ruedas: Problema:No puedo agitar mi móvil; está conectado a mi silla de ruedas. Así que tiene que existir otra forma para activar esa característica, un botón por ejemplo. Problema:Tengo temblores y por eso debo deshabilitar la activación por movimiento, y después debería ser capaz de hacer cosas sin actuación del movimiento. Funciona bien:Mi amiga tiene una aplicación interesante que parece una cerradura giratoria. Ella tiene que rotar el móvil para cambiar la combinación. Yo puedo usar la misma aplicación, pero tecleando los números directamente. Comprender la Actuación del Movimiento ### 2.5.5 Tamaño del Objetivo (AAA) El tamaño del objetivo para entradas de puntero es de al menos 44x44 píxeles de CSS, excepto cuando: Equivalente El objetivo está disponible a través de un enlace equivalente o un control en la misma página que tenga al menos 44x44 píxeles de CSS; En línea El objetivo es una frase o bloque de texto; Controlado por el Agente de Usuario El tamaño del objetivo queda determinado por el agente de usuario y no es modificado por el autor; Esencial Una presentación particular del objetivo es esencial para la información transmitida. Un jubilado con temblores en las manos (y dedos grandes): Problema:Los botones son tan pequeños que pulso en “Cancelar” cuando quiero pulsar “Enviar”. Entonces, tengo que volver a empezar otra vez. Funciona bien:Los botones del sitio web son suficientemente grandes y no me equivoco al pulsarlos incluso cuando viajo en un autobús traqueteante. Comprender el Tamaño del Objetivo ### 2.5.6 Mecanismos de Entrada Concurrentes (AAA) El contenido web no restringe el uso de las modalidades de entrada disponibles en la plataforma excepto cuando las restricciones sean esenciales, necesarias para la seguridad del contenido o necesarias para respetar los ajustes del usuario. Un periodista con trastorno musculoesquelético que usa un programa de reconocimiento de voz: Problema:Cuando mi trastorno se hace evidente, alterno bastante entre teclado, ratón, lápiz digital y voz. Esta aplicación no me deja usar el lápiz digital cuando el teclado está conectado. Comprender los Mecanismos de Entrada Concurrentes ## Pauta 4.1 Compatible Maximice la compatibilidad con agentes de usuario actuales y futuros, incluyendo las ayudas técnicas. ### 4.1.3 Mensajes de Estado (AA) En el contenido implementado usando lenguajes de marcado, los mensajes de estado se pueden determinar por software a través de roles o propiedades tales que puedan ser presentados al usuario de tecnologías de apoyo sin necesidad de recibir el foco. Un contable ciego que usa un lector de pantalla: Problema:He seleccionado una clase para la conferencia, pero no puedo decir si se ha añadido a mi agenda. Funciona bien:Cuando añado una reunión en mi calendario, oigo una confirmación. Comprender los Mensajes de Estado ## Sobre las citas de las personas Los roles de personas enlazan con las [Historias de usuarios de la web]({{ \"/people-use-web/user-stories/es\" | relative_url }}).

It also includes links to Understanding documents that explain the success criteria in detail and provide more examples. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::options toc_levels=\"2,3\" /} {::nomarkdown} {% include toc.html type=\"start\" title=\"Page Contents\" %} {:/} - This will be replaced by an automatically generated TOC when using Markdown formatting. {:toc} {::nomarkdown} {% include toc.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Introduction For an introduction to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and more about versions 2.0 and 2.1, see the [WCAG Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}). All success criteria from 2.0 are included in 2.1. The 2.0 success criteria are exactly the same (verbatim, word-for-word) in 2.1. WCAG 2.1 provides 17 additional success criteria to address: - [mobile accessibility]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/mobile/\" | relative_url }}) - people with low vision - [people with cognitive and learning disabilities]({{ \"/cognitive/\" | relative_url }}) ## Guideline 1.3 Adaptable Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure. ### 1.3.4 Orientation (AA) Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential. Comic with cerebral palsy who uses a wheelchair: Problem:I can't rotate my tablet &mdash; it's attached to my wheelchair. Works well:The application works whether I attach my tablet horizontally or vertically. Understanding Orientation ### 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose (AA) The purpose of each input field collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined when: The input field serves a purpose identified in the Input Purposes for User Interface Components section; and The content is implemented using technologies with support for identifying the expected meaning for form input data. Supermarket assistant with dyslexia and dyscalculia: Problem:My address is so complicated. There's lots of numbers and long words. It's hard to type it all without making mistakes. Works well:I love websites that can automatically fill it all in for me. Then I don't have to work so hard to get the numbers and spelling right. Note: This works because the fields use autocomplete. Understanding Identify Input Purpose ### 1.3.6 Identify Purpose (AAA) In content implemented using markup languages, the purpose of User Interface Components, icons, and regions can be programmatically determined. Gamer with language processing disability: Problem:I have software that changes the words in the navigation into symbols. It doesn't work at all with some websites. Works well:It works pretty good with some websites. Understanding Identify Purpose ## Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background. ### 1.4.10 Reflow (AA) Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for: Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels; Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels; Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning. Parent with low vision – 20/400: Problem:It's nearly impossible to read text if I have to scroll right and left to read each line. It's disorienting and I lose my place. It makes it hard to understand what I'm reading. Works well:I increase the text size 400% and it reflowed within the width of the window. I can read it easily without scrolling back and forth. Understanding Reflow ### 1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast (AA) The visual presentation of the following have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent color(s): User Interface Components Visual information required to identify user interface components and states, except for inactive components or where the appearance of the component is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author; Graphical Objects Parts of graphics required to understand the content, except when a particular presentation of graphics is essential to the information being conveyed. Retiree with low contrast sensitivity: Problem:I couldn't use the &quot;Order Form&quot; &mdash; there were no text boxes. After a long call with customer service, I learned there were text box borders that were too light for me to see. Works well:It's easy for me to see all the icons and buttons and everything &mdash; even in the sunlight. Understanding Non-text Contrast ### 1.4.12 Text Spacing (AA) In content implemented using markup languages that support the following text style properties, no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property: Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size; Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size; Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size; Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size. Exception: Human languages and scripts that do not make use of one or more of these text style properties in written text can conform using only the properties that exist for that combination of language and script. Student with dyslexia: and Retiree with low vision: Problem:Most text is hard to read. It's so cluttered I can't keep my focus. Just increasing the space between lines makes all the difference. When I'm really tired, I also increase the space between words. However, some websites don't work right &mdash; some of the text gets cut off and even buttons disappear. Works well:OK, I know I'm a bit of a geek, but I've perfected a user style sheet to make text spacing just right for me. It's a relief when websites work well with my CSS. Understanding Text Spacing ### 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus (AA) Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true: Dismissable A mechanism is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an input error or does not obscure or replace other content; Hoverable If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing; Persistent The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid. Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author. Teacher with low vision who uses screen magnification software: Problem:I was moving my mouse around to track what I was looking at on a web page. It helps me keep focused. Then -boom- this little box popped up. It covered what I was trying to read and I couldn't get it to go away. Works well:I hovered over a word and a box popped up with the definition, but it was mostly off the screen with my magnification. I moved my mouse pointer to the definition box and scrolled the magnified area over to the definition box and it stayed popped up so I could read it. Understanding Content on Hover or Focus ## Guideline 2.1 Keyboard Accessible Make all functionality available from a keyboard. ### 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (A) If a keyboard shortcut is implemented in content using only letter (including upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then at least one of the following is true: Turn off A mechanism is available to turn the shortcut off; Remap A mechanism is available to remap the shortcut to use one or more non-printable keyboard characters (e.g. Ctrl, Alt, etc). Active only on focus The keyboard shortcut for a user interface component is only active when that component has focus. Reporter with repetitive stress injury who uses voice recognition software: Problem:When I was using my mail app with voice commands, it kept deleting the messages instead of opening them. Note: There was a shortcut key for delete that was triggered by something the reporter was saying, and no way to turn off the shortcut keys. Works well:In my spreadsheet application, there's a setting to turn off or modify character key shortcuts. Understanding Character Key Shortcuts ## Guideline 2.2 Enough Time Provide users enough time to read and use content. ### 2.2.6 Timeouts (AAA) Users are warned of the duration of any user inactivity that could cause data loss, unless the data is preserved for more than 20 hours when the user does not take any actions. School playground aide with cognitive disabilities: Problem:I was selecting my Employee Benefits and was comparing the different plans. When I went back to select the Health Plan, it had timed out and lost all the information I had already entered. Works well:When I started the Employee Benefits app, it told me how many minutes I had to complete the forms. Understanding Timeouts ## Guideline 2.3 Seizures and Physical Reactions Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions. ### 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions (AAA) Motion animation triggered by interaction can be disabled, unless the animation is essential to the functionality or the information being conveyed. Artist with vestibular disorder: Problem:In the online tax app, as I move my mouse around or tab to different fields, this little bubble with the current balance follows me around the screen. Makes me dizzy and nauseous. Works well:I was so glad there was an option to turn off animations. Understanding Animation from Interactions ## Guideline 2.5 Input Modalities Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs beyond keyboard. ### 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (A) All functionality that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a single pointer without a path-based gesture, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is essential. Comic with cerebral palsy who has limited movement in fingers: Problem:I can't move my fingers like that. I need another way to zoom in the map. Works well:Good thing there are buttons to zoom in and out. Understanding Pointer Gestures ### 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation (A) For functionality that can be operated using a single pointer, at least one of the following is true: No Down-Event The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function; Abort or Undo Completion of the function is on the up-event, and a mechanism is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion; Up Reversal The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event; Essential Completing the function on the down-event is essential. Politician with motor disabilities and low vision: Problem:I went to hit the &quot;Mute&quot; button and accidentally touched the &quot;End Call&quot; button instead. It hung up immediately. Works well:In another web conferencing application, if I accidentally touch the &quot;End Call&quot; button, I can just slide my finger off the &quot;End Call&quot; button and it won't end the call. Understanding Pointer Cancellation ### 2.5.3 Label in Name (A) For user interface components with labels that include text or images of text, the name contains the text that is presented visually. Reporter with repetitive stress injury who uses voice recognition software: Problem:It understood most of my voice commands until I got to the Send button. I kept saying 'Send' and it didn't work. Note: It was visually labeled 'send' but the 'name' in the code was 'submit'. It would have worked if the 'name' started with 'send'. Understanding Label in Name ### 2.5.4 Motion Actuation (A) Functionality that can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be operated by user interface components and responding to the motion can be disabled to prevent accidental actuation, except when: Supported Interface The motion is used to operate functionality through an accessibility supported interface; Essential The motion is essential for the function and doing so would invalidate the activity. Comic with cerebral palsy who uses a wheelchair: Problem:I can't shake my phone; it's connected to my wheelchair. So there needs to be another way to activate that feature, like a button. Problem:I have tremors, so I need to turn off motion activation &mdash; and then be able to do stuff without motion actuation. Works well:My friend has this cool application that looks like a physical spin lock. She rotates the phone to turn to the combination. I can use the same application by typing the numbers directly. Understanding Motion Actuation ### 2.5.5 Target Size (AAA) The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels except when: Equivalent The target is available through an equivalent link or control on the same page that is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels; Inline The target is in a sentence or block of text; User Agent Control The size of the target is determined by the user agent and is not modified by the author; Essential A particular presentation of the target is essential to the information being conveyed. Retiree with hand tremor (and big fingers): Problem:The buttons are so small, I hit &quot;Cancel&quot; when going for &quot;Submit&quot;. Then I have to start all over again. Works well:This website buttons are big enough that I don't hit the wrong button even when I'm riding on the bumpy bus. Understanding Target Size ### 2.5.6 Concurrent Input Mechanisms (AAA) Web content does not restrict use of input modalities available on a platform except where the restriction is essential, required to ensure the security of the content, or required to respect user settings. Reporter with repetitive stress injury who uses voice recognition software: Problem:When my RSI acts up, I switch back and forth a lot between keyboard, mouse, stylus, voice. This application doesn't let me use the stylus when I have a keyboard plugged in. Understanding Concurrent Input Mechanisms ## Guideline 4.1 Compatible Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies. ### 4.1.3 Status Messages (AA) In content implemented using markup languages, status messages can be programmatically determined through role or properties such that they can be presented to the user by assistive technologies without receiving focus. Accountant who is blind and uses a screen reader: Problem:I selected a class for the conference, but I can't tell if it got added to my schedule. Works well:When I add a meeting to my calendar, I hear a confirmation.

WCAG 2.2 is scheduled to be completed and published in 2021. Current drafts: * [WCAG 2.2 Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) is approved to be posted as a draft * [Editors' Draft of WCAG 2.2](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/) may have more recent updates that are not yet approved If you have comments on the WCAG 2.2 Draft: Please submit any comments on the proposed new success criteria **by 11 June 2021**. Ideally open one [new GitHub issue]( https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/new) per discrete comment. If you’re not comfortable with GitHub, you can send comments to public-agwg-comments@w3.org ### Changes from WCAG 2.1 to WCAG 2.2 All success criteria from 2.0 and 2.1 are included in 2.2. The 2.0 and 2.1 success criteria are exactly the same (verbatim, word-for-word) in 2.2. **One changed level: [2.4.7 Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-visible)** is changed from Level AA in WCAG 2.1 to Level A in WCAG 2.2. WCAG 2.2 Working Draft provides 9 additional success criteria, that are included on this page. ### Changes to 2.2 Working Draft Changes from the 11 August 2020 to 11 May 2021 Working Draft include: * Accessible authentication: Incorporates concepts of ‘steps’ to account for multi-factor authentication, and explicitly allows for ‘mechanisms’ like password managers. * Dragging movement: A very minor wording update. * Consistent help: Renamed from “Findable help”, and follows the ‘consistent navigation’ criterion more closely. * Page Break Navigation: Renamed, the criterion text is reduced to focus on content which already implements programmatic page break locators. * Focus appearance (minimum): Restructured the criterion text, whilst keeping the requirement essentially the same. * Focus appearance (enhanced): Aligned with the minimum version. * Visible control: Renamed (from Hidden controls), added several exceptions. * Target size (minimum): Renamed (from Pointer target Spacing), reduced the core size requirement to 24px, and simplified the criterion text. * Redundant entry: Removed the ‘steps in a process’ aspect, added a within-session scope, and added several exceptions. ## Guideline 2.4 Navigable Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are. ### 2.4.11 Focus Appearance (Minimum) (AA) When user interface components receive keyboard focus, all of the following are true: Contrasting area: There is an area of the focus indicator that has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the colors in the focused and unfocused states. Minimum area: The contrasting area is at least as large as: Outline: the area of a 1 CSS pixel thick perimeter of the unfocused component, or Shape: the area of a 4 CSS pixel thick line along the shortest side of a minimum bounding box of the unfocused component, and no thinner than 2 CSS pixels. Adjacent contrast: The contrasting area also has a contrast ratio of least 3:1 against adjacent colors in the focused component, or the contrasting area has a thickness of at least 2 CSS pixels. Not fully obscured: The item with focus is not entirely hidden by author-created content. Note A keyboard focus indicator which has a pattern or gradient may have parts that do not meet the 3:1 contrast ratio for the change of contrast, as long as an area equal to the minimum does meet the contrast ratio. Note If the component has a visible boundary smaller than the hit area, or the size of the component is not available, the minimum area can be taken from the visible boundary. Editor's note The working group is interested in feedback about the minimum area metric, and if there are unusual scenarios where visible indicators are caught by the wording. Reporter with repetitive stress injury who doesn't use a mouse: and Retiree with low contrast sensitivity: Problem:I can't tell where the keyboard focus is as I move around a web page or app. Works well:I can see where the keyboard focus is as I move around a web page or app. Understanding Focus Appearance (Minimum) ### 2.4.12 Focus Appearance (Enhanced) (AAA) When user interface components have keyboard focus, all of the following are true: Contrasting area: There is an area of the focus indicator that has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 between the colors in the focused and unfocused states. Minimum area: The contrasting area is at least double the area of a 1 CSS pixel perimeter of the unfocused component; Not obscured: No part of the focus indicator is hidden by author-created content. Reporter with repetitive stress injury who doesn't use a mouse: and Retiree with low contrast sensitivity: Problem:I can't tell where the keyboard focus is as I move around a web page or app. Works well:I can easily see where the keyboard focus is as I move around a web page or app. Understanding Focus Appearance (Enhanced) ### 2.4.13 Page Break Navigation (A) For web content with page break locators, a mechanism is available to navigate to each locator. Student with dyslexia: and Retiree with low vision: Problem:I increase the text size and spacing in the online textbook. The instructor said: \"The activity is on page 37.\" But it's not on page 37 in my view, and I cannot find it. Works well:I used the page contents list to get to \"page 37\". (It's actually page 53 in my view — that's OK, I found it.) Page Break Navigation ## Guideline 2.5 Input Modalities Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs beyond keyboard. ### 2.5.7 Dragging (AA) All functionality that uses a dragging movement for operation can be achieved by a single pointer without dragging, unless dragging is essential. Note This requirement applies to web content that interprets pointer actions (i.e. this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology). Editor's note Is there an assistive technology that helps for people with mobility impairments? The group would like feedback on the frontier between AT &amp; author responsibility. Retiree with hand tremor: Problem:I cannot hold down the mouse button and drag it accurately enough to move the items in this list. Works well:When I click on an item in the list, I get up and down arrows and I can click those to change the order. Understanding Dragging ### 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) (AA) Targets have an area of at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels, except where: Spacing: The target offset is at least 24 CSS pixels to every adjacent target; Inline: The target is in a sentence or block of text; Essential: A particular presentation of the target is essential to the information being conveyed. Note Targets that allow for values to be selected spatially based on position within the target are considered one target for the purpose of the success criterion. Examples include sliders with granular values, color pickers displaying a gradient of colors, or editable areas where you position the cursor. Editor's note Are there issues with internationalization when describing inline links? Editor's note Are there issues with pop-over content overlapping targets triggering failures? Retiree with hand tremor: Problem:The buttons are so close together, I hit \"Cancel\" when going for \"Submit\". Then I have to start all over again. Works well:There is more space between the buttons so I don't hit the wrong button even when I'm riding on the bumpy bus. Understanding Target Size (Minimum) ## Guideline 3.2 Predictable Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways. ### 3.2.6 Consistent Help (A) For each web page within a set of web pages that provides one or more of the following ways of finding help, access to at least one form of help is included in the same relative order on each page: Human contact details; Human contact mechanism; Self-help option; A fully automated contact mechanism. Note Access to help mechanisms may be provided directly on the page, or may be provided via a direct link to a different page containing the information. Supermarket assistant with cognitive disabilities: Problem:Whenever I use the online app to schedule my medical appointments, I can't remember what to do at each step. I've seen a Chat option in some places, but can't find it now. Works well:When I need help, I can easily find the Chat option that's always in the lower right corner of the page. Understanding Consistent Help ### 3.2.7 Visible Controls (AA) Where receiving pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers user interface components to be visible, information needed to identify that user interface components are available is visible, except when: The information needed to identify the user interface components is available through an equivalent component that is visible on the same page or on a different step in a multi-step process without requiring pointer hover or keyboard focus; The component is provided specifically to enhance the experience for keyboard navigation; A mechanism is available to make the information persistently visible; Hiding the information needed to identify the component is essential. Note User interface components can be available through other visible components such as sub-menus, edit buttons, tabs, or thumbnails of media. Editor's note The working group is interested in feedback about whether there are Components determined by the user agent that should not be in scope. Supermarket assistant with cognitive disabilities: Problem:I can't tell what options are available. Some buttons appeared when I was mousing around, but now I can't find them. Works well:The available buttons are all visible, without me having to mouse around. Understanding Visible Controls ## Guideline 3.3 Input Assistance Help users avoid and correct mistakes. ### 3.3.7 Accessible Authentication (A) For each step in an authentication process that relies on a cognitive function test, at least one other authentication method is available that does not rely on a cognitive function test, or a mechanism is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test. Note Examples of mechanisms include: 1) support for password entry by password managers to address the memorization cognitive function test, and 2) copy and paste to help address transcription cognitive function test. Supermarket assistant with cognitive disabilities: Problem:I don't understand what they want me to type in or click on to get into this app. Works well:To get into this app, I can put my e-mail address. Then I get an e-mail message, and I can click a link in the e-mail to get into the app. Understanding Accessible Authentication ### 3.3.8 Redundant Entry (A) Information previously entered by or provided to the user that is required to be entered again in the same process and in the same user-session is either: auto-populated, or available for the user to select. Except when: re-entering the information is essential, the information is required to ensure the security of the content, or previously entered information is no longer valid. Editor's note Are there issues storing the data so a user can access it in subsequent steps? Editor's note Are there broader exceptions needed than essential? E.g. for mandated or required information re-entry. Supermarket assistant with cognitive disabilities: Problem:Whenever I use the online app to schedule my medical appointments, I have to re-type some information that I entered in a previous step. Works well:The app automatically fills in information that I entered in previous steps. Understanding Redundant Entry ## About the Personas Quotes The linked persona roles go to the [Stories of Web Users]({{ \"/people-use-web/user-stories/\" | relative_url }}). That page has other personas with different disabilities. We might add more in the future. We plan to add persona quotes to the Understanding WCAG documents.",

It supports harmonized accessibility solutions across a range of technologies. *Background:* **WCAG 2.0** is a normative web standard — it is a W3C Recommendation and an ISO International Standard ([ISO/IEC 40500:2012](https://www.w3.org/QA/2012/10/wcag_20_is_now_also_isoiec_405.html)) — that explains how to make web content (including static web pages, dynamic web applications, etc.) more accessible to people with disabilities. The [WCAG Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}) introduces the WCAG documents and links to supporting resources such as [WCAG 2.0 at a Glance]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/20/glance/\" | relative_url }}) and [How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/). *This document:* **WCAG2ICT** is a W3C Working Group Note that is informative — it is not normative and does not set requirements. It provides guidance on the application of WCAG 2.0 principles, guidelines, and success criteria to non-web documents and software. WCAG2ICT was developed to provide an authoritative interpretation of how WCAG 2.0 can apply in different contexts. For information on the scope of WCAG2ICT, see the [WCAG2ICT Introduction](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/#intro). *Note:* **WCAG2ICT is still relevant for later versions of WCAG 2**. For example, WCAG 2.1 does not change the requirements of WCAG 2.0 that are addressed in WCAG2ICT; WCAG 2.1 adds additional requirements. W3C may update WCAG2ICT in the future to add the additional requirements from later versions of WCAG 2. ## Who WCAG2ICT is for {#for} WCAG2ICT is for ICT managers, ICT developers, policy makers, and others wanting to understand how WCAG 2.0 can be applied to non-web documents and software. ## What is in WCAG2ICT {#whatis} WCAG2ICT provides: - **Overall context** for applying WCAG 2.0 to non-web documents and software. - **Guidance on applying the WCAG principles, guidelines, and Levels A and AA success criteria** to non-web documents and software. - **Key Terms** related to applying WCAG 2.0 to non-web documents and software. - **Comments on the definitions** in the WCAG 2.0 Glossary. - **Comments on conformance**. - **Background information** on some topics. WCAG2ICT includes material from the WCAG 2.0 standard to provide context, along with specific guidance related to non-web ICT, formatted as follows: - **WCAG 2.0 principles, guidelines, and success criteria** — the exact text from the WCAG 2.0 standard. *These are visually styled in pale yellow boxes and usually prefaced with \"Principle...\", \"From Guideline...\", or \"From Success Criterion..\".* - **Excerpted text from the \"Intent\" sections of Understanding WCAG 2.0**, an informative supporting document. *These are visually styled in pale yellow boxes and prefaced with \"Intent from Understanding Success Criterion...\".* - **Guidance on applying each success criteria to non-web documents and software**. *These are visually styled in pale blue boxes with a heading on a dark blue background that starts with \"Additional Guidance...\".* ### Technical document format WCAG2ICT follows the [W3C](https://www.w3.org) format for technical reports, which has several sections at the beginning, including links to different versions, editors, abstract, and status. ## Who develops WCAG2ICT {#wg} WCAG2ICT was developed by the [WCAG2ICT Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG2ICT-TF/), provided for public review, and approved by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group ([WCAG WG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/)), which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/)) Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)). ### Comments WCAG2ICT is now a stable W3C Working Group Note, and the WCAG Working Group does not plan to make changes. However, the document can be updated if needed. If you have any comments on the Additional Guidance sections of WCAG2ICT, please send them to the public mailing list . If you have comments on the wording taken from WCAG 2.0 or Understanding WCAG 2.0, please read the [Instructions for Commenting on WCAG 2 Documents]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/commenting/\" | relative_url }}).",

Demonstrate the use of the WAI-ARIA properties `role=\"heading\"` and `level=\"1-6\"` when HTML headings cannot be used. Explain how different people use headings for orientation and navigation. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * explain how headings and their rank levels are used by different types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies, such as text to speech and custom stylesheets, to allow people with disabilities to understand and navigate the content * write markup for headings using the HTML elements `h1` through `h6`, and using the WAI-ARIA properties `role=\"heading\"` and `level=\"1-6\"` when HTML headings cannot be used * rank heading levels according to the hierarchical structure of the content * describe related requirements for authors and designers to provide meaningful texts and distinguishable styles for headings #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Explain that headings are organized in a hierarchical structure, i.e., h1 being the first rank and h6 being the last one. Emphasize that native HTML elements are more likely to be supported by browsers and assistive technologies. Show examples of how headings can be nested to distinguish and label different sections and subsections of content. Examples of how to structure pages using headings are provided in the WAI Tutorials on [Headings that Reflect the Page Organization](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/#headings-that-reflect-the-page-organization). * Present examples of headings and reflect with students if they are descriptive of the sections they entitle. Mention that providing descriptive headings is a shared responsibility among different team members: content authors, designers, and developers. Descriptions of how to mark up headings to organize passages of text are provided in the WAI Tutorials on [Organize Passages of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/#organize-passages-of-text). * Demonstrate the use of voice commands, keystrokes, and gestures provided by assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to navigate web pages through headings. Explore advanced functionality that some tools provide, such as presenting all headings in a list where users can select the heading they are interested in. Examples of how people with disabilities interact with the Web are provided in [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/). #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to assess knowledge: * Short Answer Questions &mdash; Ask students how many heading levels there are in the HTML specification, and how each of the heading levels can be coded. Assess students' knowledge of the HTML elements `h1` through `h6`, as well as the WAI-ARIA properties `role=\"heading\"` and `level=\"1-6\"`. * Practical &mdash; Give students a web page that contains incorrect heading ranks and ask students to use `h1` through `h6` elements to indicate the correct heading structure. Assess how students relate the visual layout of the page with the underlying structure. * Practical &mdash; Give students headings that do not describe the sections they entitle and ask students to replace the text of the headings with descriptive information. Assess how students provide descriptive titles for sections. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: Sections of Content {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Explain the use of HTML elements to convey the structure of contents. For example, the proper coding of sections, paragraphs, and lists. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * explain how properly coded sections of content can be presented in different ways; for example, read aloud using text-to-speech technologies, rendered using custom styling, and displayed in different screen and text sizes * describe the purpose of the HTML elements `section`, `article`, `p`, `ul`, `ol`, `li`, `dl`, `dt`, and `dd` * write markup for sections of content using the HTML elements `section` and `article` * write markup for paragraphs using the HTML element `p` * write markup for lists using the HTML element `ul`, `ol`, and `dl` * write markup for list items using the HTML elements `li`, `dt`, and `dd` * write markup for inline and block quotes using the HTML elements `q` and `blockquote` respectively * apply corresponding WAI-ARIA properties when native HTML elements cannot be used * describe related requirements for content authors to use appropriate structures to convey content meaning, such as paragraphs and lists #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Define the `section` element as a thematic grouping of content. An example of how to mark up the `section` element is provided in the WAI Tutorials on [Sections](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#sections). * Define the `article` element as a self-containing unit within the web page. An example of how to mark up the `article` element is provided in the WAI Tutorials on [Articles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#articles). * Explain that the `p` element is used to mark up paragraphs of text. An example of how to mark up the `paragraph` element is provided in the WAI Tutorials on [Paragraphs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#paragraphs). * Explain that unordered lists are used to group items where the numbering is not relevant, and ordered lists are used when numbering of items matters. Explain that these lists are marked up with the `ul` or `ol` element, and each of the items is coded with the `li` element. Emphasize that each of the list items can contain headings, paragraphs, and other lists. An example of how to mark up unordered lists is provided in the WAI Tutorials on [Lists](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#lists). * Define description lists as a grouping of several terms and descriptions. Description lists are marked up with the `dl` element, terms are marked up with the `dt` element, and descriptions are marked up with the `dd` element. Examples of how to mark up description lists are provided in the WAI Tutorials on [Description Lists](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#description-lists). * Define quotes as text attributed to another author. Explain that there can be inline or block quotes, and that they are marked up using the HTML elements `q` and `blockquote` respectively. Examples of how to mark up quotes are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Quotes](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/#quotes). #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to assess knowledge: * Research &mdash; Students research the HTML specification and provide information about the different ways of coding sections of content. Assess students' knowledge of the HTML elements for marking up content. * Practical &mdash; Give students several types of lists and ask students to code them using their corresponding HTML list element. Assess students' knowledge of the different types of lists. * Practical &mdash; Give students a passage of text containing several sections, paragraphs, lists, and quotes. Ask students to code the passage using the corresponding HTML elements. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: Page Regions {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Explain the use of common markup to identify page regions, such as header, footer, navigation, and main content areas. Explain how page regions support orientation and navigation for people with disabilities. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * explain how properly coded page regions can be presented in different ways; for example, read aloud using text-to-speech technologies, rendered using custom styling, and displayed in different screen and text sizes * describe the purpose of the HTML elements `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, and `footer` * write markup for regions of a page using the HTML elements `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, and `footer`, as well as their corresponding WAI-ARIA landmarks when HTML structures cannot be used * label regions using HTML headings, `aria-label`, and `aria-labelledby` when necessary #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Show examples of different page layouts, and their markup of the header, navigation, main content, section, article, complementary, and footer regions. Emphasize that native HTML elements are more likely to be supported by newer browsers and assistive technologies. Examples of using HTML elements to code page regions are provided in the WAI Tutorials on [Regions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/). * Explain that WAI-ARIA landmarks provide broader support for old assistive technologies and browsers. Emphasize that they can also enhance HTML 4 semantics if applied to an ordinary `div` element. Examples of using WAI-ARIA landmarks to code page regions are provided in the WAI Tutorials on [Page Regions in HTML5 Using WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/#accessupport). * Show examples of providing labels for page regions, included by using HTML headings, `aria-label`, and `aria-labelledby`. Explain that page regions need to be labeled to distinguish them from one another, for example when two regions of the same type are used in a web page. Descriptions of how to label page regions are provided in the WAI Tutorials on [Labeling regions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/labels/). * Demonstrate the use of voice commands, keystrokes, and gestures provided by assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to navigate page regions. Explore advanced functionality that some tools provide, such as presenting all page regions in a list or tree where users can select the region they are interested in. Examples of how people with disabilities interact with the Web are provided in [Stories of Web Users](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/). * Invite students to try out functionality built-in to some browsers to facilitate reading. Explain that it changes the layout of the page, showing the main content of a web page when it is marked up appropriately. Discuss with students how this can improve readability for all users. Refer to the support pages of browsers for more information on the particular reading modes they provide. #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to assess knowledge: * Short Answer Questions &mdash; Ask students about the types of page regions and how each of these can be coded in HTML and WAI-ARIA. Assess students' knowledge of the different coding techniques for page regions. * Practical &mdash; Give students several page layouts and ask students to mark them up using HTML elements and WAI-ARIA landmarks. Assess students' knowledge of the different types of page regions and the different coding techniques to mark them up. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: Page Orientation and Navigation {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Explain how page regions, sections of content, and section headings (described in prior topics) are combined to provide a coherent over-arching page structure. Explain how orientation and navigation across the page is facilitated by additional mechanisms, such as links, visible focus indicator, meaningful sequence, and meta-information. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * write markup for page titles to identify web pages * write markup for the primary language of web pages to allow correct interpretation by assistive technologies * label blocks of content repeated on multiple pages with consistent names * write code to allow people using only the keyboard to skip over blocks of repeated content * write code that allows to present content in a meaningful sequence * write code for distinguishable focus indicators, for example by using the CSS `:focus` selector * describe related requirements for content authors to write meaningful link texts and page titles * describe related requirements for designers to provide distinguishable focus indicators for links and other navigational elements * describe related requirements for content authors and designers to provide clear layouts and designs that support different viewport sizes #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Demonstrate the use of the HTML element `title` within the `head` element to convey the topic or purpose of the page. Show examples of where and how browsers and assistive technologies show the contents of the `title` element: screen reader keystrokes, browser tabs, browser window titles, and search results. Relate this requirement to WCAG success criterion [2.4.2 Page Titled](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#page-titled). Examples of how to provide descriptive titles are provided in techniques [G88: Providing descriptive titles for Web pages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G88.html) and [H25: Providing a title using the title element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H25). Examples of how to write page titles are provided in the Easy Checks resource, section [Page title](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/#title). * Demonstrate the use of the `lang` attribute, together with a valid language tag, to convey the main language of a web page. Explain that it is placed within the `html` tag. Examples of how to convey the main language of a web page are provided in technique [H57: Using the language attribute on the HTML element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H57.html). * Emphasize that, when there is a passage of text in a different language than the default, the `lang` attribute needs to be used with a valid language tag that corresponds to the language of that passage. For an explanation of how to code the `lang` attribute to convey changes in language, see [H58: Using language attributes to identify changes in the human language](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H58.html). * Demonstrate the use of HTML links and other navigational elements, such as those that allow to bypass blocks of content that repeats on multiple pages. Mention that these links need to have the HTML attribute `href`, together with a value containing their destination in the form of a uniform resource identifier (URI). Explain that people using only the keyboard rely on bypass blocks mechanisms to skip large blocks of repetitive content, such as headers and navigation bars. Examples of how to code such links are provided in technique [G1: Adding a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G1.html). * Show content in different layouts, for example, with different style sheets applied. Emphasize that content always needs to follow a meaningful sequence that allows to adapt the content to different ways of presentation. For information on how to ensure a meaningful sequence, see technique [G57: Ordering the content in a meaningful sequence](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G57). * Emphasize that keeping focus order is needed for consistency between the visual and programmatic order of items. Show examples of web pages where source order matches visual presentation and compare them with pages where it does not. Link this requirement to WCAG success criterion [2.4.3 Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#focus-order). * Show examples of default and custom visual focus indicators. Explain that these indicators can help people know where they are as they browse the web page. Mention that it is sometimes best practice to provide custom indicators for better visibility and contrast ratios. Link this requirement to WCAG success criterion [2.4.7 Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#focus-visible). #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practical &mdash; Give students a set of web pages. Ask students to choose a title that best describes each of the pages and code it appropriately. Assess students' knowledge of the `title` element and how to provide descriptive content. * Practical &mdash; Give students several passages of text written in different languages and ask students to code them using the correct language tag. Assess students' knowledge of how to code the different language tags. * Practical &mdash; Students build a mechanism to bypass blocks of content. Assess students' understanding of the difference between repeated blocks and content specific to a web page. * Short answer questions &mdash; Ask students about different navigational mechanisms they are aware of and request students to explain their main features. Assess students' knowledge of how people navigate within web pages and find specific content. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"all\" %} ## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practical &mdash; Supervise students using different mechanisms that assistive technologies provide to move to next and previous heading and to show all the headings of a web page in an isolated list. Assess students’ knowledge of mechanisms of assistive technologies to move through headings. * Practical &mdash; Supervise students using different mechanisms that assistive technologies provide to move to next and previous region and to show all the regions of a web page in an isolated list. Assess students’ knowledge of mechanisms of assistive technologies to move through regions. * Practical &mdash; Supervise students using different mechanisms that assistive technologies provide to check page titles. Assess students' knowledge of mechanisms of assistive technologies to check page titles. * Portfolio &mdash; Students build a simple web page with proper structure and semantics. Assess how students mark up different features, including regions of the page, sections of content, headings, passages of text, title, and page language. ## Teaching Resources Suggested resources to support your teaching: * [Page Structure (WAI Web Accessibility Tutorials)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure) &mdash; Shows how to provide page structures that are accessible to people with disabilities. * [How People with Disabilities Use the Web]({{ \"/people-use-web/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; Describes some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies that some people use. * [Text to Speech (Web Accessibility Perspective)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/speech/) &mdash; Is one of the Web accessibility perspectives videos that show accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities. * [Clear Layout and Design (Web Accessibility Perspectives)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/layout/) &mdash; Is one of the Web accessibility perspectives videos that show accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities. * [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) &mdash; Address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. * [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) &mdash; Describes the roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements and can be used to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications. * [HTML5 living standard {% include_cached icon.html name=\"external-link\" %}](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) &mdash; The core markup language for the web.",

Ask students to gather information on the assistive technologies and/or adaptive strategies used to interact with digital technology. Help students classify the tools they learn about. * Guide students to focus on the abilities of people with disabilities and on how technology is part of their everyday life. Coach students towards thinking about people first and promote an inclusive approach. For further information, refer to [Interacting with People with Disabilities](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/interact.html). * Present some assistive technologies and adaptive strategies, such as captions, text customization (e.g., font size, color, or spacing), specialized keyboards, audio descriptions, screen readers, and screen magnifiers. Mention things like glasses as a type of assistive technology. * Demonstrate the use of assistive technology by experienced users. Note that some tools are not easy for novices. Ask users to show examples of accessible content first, then inaccessible content. * Encourage students to try some adaptive strategies following expert advice by exploring different settings in web browsers and operating systems. * Discuss with students various accessibility design features of common sites or devices, as well as access barriers that people experience with digital content. **Important**: Avoid showing disabilities as being limiting, uncomfortable, or heroic. For information on avoiding clichés and myths, see [Interacting with People with Disabilities {% include_cached external.html %}](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/interact.html). #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Report &mdash; Students write a report describing some of the design features that one of the assistive technologies they learned about relies on to function. Assess students' capacity to identify how people with disabilities rely on specific features to use the Web. * Practice &mdash; Students go to three different types of websites (e.g., shopping site, banking site, or entertainment site) and identify accessibility features from those they learned about. Assess students' capacity to recognize accessibility features. * Interview &mdash; Students contact a person with a disability and interview them. Explore what accessibility features and barriers they encounter when trying to access digital content or applications, as well as how up-to-date they are with technology. Assess students' capacity to identify such features and barriers and link them to the knowledge they acquired. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: Components of Web Accessibility {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Explain that web accessibility depends on several components working together: content, browsers, authoring tools, web designers and developers, and more. Briefly note that there are W3C Standards for the different components. (The standards are explored in detail in [Module 4]({{ \"/curricula/foundation-modules/principles-standards-and-checks/\" | relative_url }}).) For an explanation of the components and how they link together, see [Essential Components of Web Accessibility]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}). #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * Describe the components that contribute to accessibility. * Explain some of the links between the components. * Describe the impact that some Web technologies have on digital accessibility. * Identify W3C standards that address the components. #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Based on the previously taught topics, reflect with students on the links between assistive technologies, adaptive strategies, and digital content. Guide them through how one relies on the other and how using different combinations of tools may yield different user experiences. * Explore with students some of the accessibility features built into Web technologies. For example, HTML headings and lists. Ask students to reflect on how these relate to prior observations they made. * Reflect with students on the roles of browsers and media players; for example, explain that a media player needs to support captions or audio descriptions. Encourage them to explore accessibility support in different tools. * Reflect with students on the role of authoring tools, such as Content Management Systems (CMS). For example, does their preferred social media platform include options to provide text alternatives for images? * Introduce potential options to improve accessibility in different situations. Guide students to reflect on the implications of using a more accessible browser, exploring accessibility platforms and APIs, and requiring accessibility during procurement. #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Reflective Journal &mdash; Students reflect on specific types of accessibility features and barriers, and how they relate to the different components of web accessibility. Assess students' capacity to recognize how components work together to improve accessibility. * Guided Quiz &mdash; Students identify three websites where one accessibility feature in Web technology is being used. For example, Where are ordered and unordered lists used effectively? Where is heading structure in place? Assess students' capacity to identify instances of content that promote accessibility features. * Presentation &mdash; Students use a variety of websites with three different browsers and assistive technologies. Students explain any differences between accessing the content with the different browsers and assistive technologies. Students share with others which browser they think works best and why. Assess students' capacity to identify the way user agents and assistive technologies render content has an impact on accessibility. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} ## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practice &mdash; Students perform basic tasks with assistive technologies, such as using the tab key to navigate different interfaces or using screen readers' navigation quick keys. Assess students' capacity to interact with assistive technologies. * Multiple Choice Questions &mdash; From a list of 10 - 15 accessibility barriers. Students decide for each of them if they are related to the content, the underlying technology, the user agent, and/or assistive technology. Assess students' capacity to relate the different components of web accessibility. * Presentation &mdash; Students describe how some adaptive strategies may benefit other users as well, such as older adults. Assess students' capacity to identify some patterns of use and relate them to different user groups, regardless of disability. * Report &mdash; Students identify the components of web accessibility and explain how they relate to each other to create an accessible experience. For example, students reflect on how a content creator provides a text alternative that is properly coded, supported by the browser, and rendered to the user via their assistive technology. ## Teaching Resources Suggested resources to support your teaching: * [How People with Disabilities Use the Web]({{ \"/people-use-web/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; Provides stories of people with disabilities using the Web; describes types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies that some people use. * [Web Accessibility Perspectives (videos)]({{ \"/perspective-videos/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; Is a series of 1-minute videos that demonstrate that web accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for all.

Otherwise, they might think that you accidentally forgot to provide it. Users who need captions will look there, so you can provide a captions file with only the appropriate indication, such as \"[background music]\". Or you can provide the information in text with the video, such as: {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" class=\"\" %} {:/} Captions not needed: The only sound in this video is background music. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" class=\"\" %} {:/} Description not needed: The visuals in this video only support what is spoken; the visuals do not provide additional information. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ### Provide Both Captions and a Transcript {#captions-and-transcript} It is best to provide captions and a separate transcript. For videos, captions enable people who are Deaf or hard of hearing to see the visual content and read the captions at the same time. For audio-only, captions enable people who are hard of hearing to get the richness of listening to the audio and fill in what they don't hear well by reading the captions. Transcripts are needed to provide access to people who are Deaf-blind and use braille. Also, transcripts are used by people without disabilities, as listed in the intro page of this resource under [Benefits to Organizations and Individuals]({{ \"/media/av/\" | relative_url }}#benefits). ### Descriptive Transcripts Descriptive transcripts for videos: * are needed for most videos to be accessible to people who are \"Deaf-blind\" * meet a wide range of accessibility needs, including for people who have difficulty processing auditory information and people who cannot focus and comprehend auditory or visual information when there is changing visuals * are used by people _without_ disabilities, and benefit your organization (examples are in the intro page under [Benefits to Organizations and Individuals]({{ \"/media/av/\" | relative_url }}#benefits)) * **are easy and inexpensive to develop** using captions and description that you already have to meet Level AA **Captions and transcripts use the same text. Once you have one, it's fairly easy to develop the other.** ### Other Languages Translation of the audio into other languages can be provided: * as text, using captions format (called subtitles or interlingual subtitles) * as spoken audio, usually as a separate audio stream (for people who cannot read captions) * as sign language ## Project Management Include specific accessibility requirements in your: * Project requirements - internal and external * Requests for Proposal (RFP) or Requests for Tender (RFT) * Contracts Here is an example workflow for developing an accessible video, with notes on who develops the material. Links go to other pages in this resource. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Example Workflow and Responsibilities\" class=\"\" %} {:/} 1.

    "text": "{::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Summary\" class=\"\" %} {:/} Some media players are not accessible to people with disabilities. There are players developed specifically for accessibility. Usually it's best to use one of these existing players, rather than code your own. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::nomarkdown} {% include toc.html type=\"start\" title=\"Page Contents\" %} {:/} - This will be replaced by an automatically generated TOC when using Markdown formatting. {:toc} {::nomarkdown} {% include toc.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Introduction Modern browsers provide a default media player. Most have limited functionality to support accessibility. Rather than coding all the things needed to make a player support accessibility, most organizations choose to use an existing player with good accessibility support. There are players developed specifically for accessibility. Some are free, open source and some are commercial. ## Skills Needed {#skills} Using an existing media player developed for accessibility requires moderate HTML skills. Developing your own accessible media player requires advanced HTML and JavaScript skills. ## Player Accessibility Functionality Accessible media players provide a user interface that works without a mouse, through speech interface, when the page is zoomed larger, and with screen readers. For example, media players need to: * Provide keyboard support ([in Understanding WCAG: Keyboard Accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard-accessible)) * Make the keyboard focus indicator visible ([in Understanding WCAG: Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-visible)) * Provide clear labels ([in Understanding WCAG: Labels or Instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/labels-or-instructions), [Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships)) * Have sufficient contrast between colors for text, controls, and backgrounds ([in Understanding WCAG: Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum), [Contrast (Enhanced)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced), [Non-text Contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html)) Some media players provide additional accessibility functionality to users such as: * Changing the speed of the video * Setting how captions are displayed (e.g., text style, text size, colors, and position of the captions) * Reading the captions with a screen reader and braille device * Interactive transcripts Interactive transcripts use the captions file. Interactive transcripts highlight text phrases as they are spoken. Users can select text in the transcript and go to that point in the video. More details on player accessibility functionality are in a separate document: [Media Accessibility User Requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/). ## Existing Players There is information online about the accessibility of media players. For example, [Web-Based Media Player Accessibility Comparison Table _(last updated July 2016)_ {% include_cached external.html %}](http://kensgists.github.io/apt/). Each media player provides documentation of the steps to set it up in a web page. For example, [AblePlayer Setup Steps {% include_cached external.html %}](https://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer/#setup-step-1-use-html5-doctype). ### Support for Description Methods Media player functionality is required for some methods of providing audio description of visual information, as described in the [Description page]({{ \"/media/av/description/\" | relative_url }}). To the best of our knowledge, the following media players provide such functionality: * Supports description in text file (VTT format): * AblePlayer &mdash; supports description when there is space in the audio, and when the video needs to pause (\"extended description\") * video.js &mdash; supports description when there is space in the audio; does **not** support description when the video needs to pause (\"extended description\") * Supports separate audio file with description: * AblePlayer * OzPlayer * video.js &mdash; with plug-in _(If you know of other players that provide that functionality, please let us know via GitHub or e-mail with the links in [Help improve this page below](#helpimprove).

Assess student's capacity to outline overall differences and similarities between the chosen guidelines. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: Hands-on Experience of Standards {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Give students hands-on experience checking how web pages have implemented accessibility principles and WCAG standards, or not. Use examples from [Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility]({{ \"/test-evaluate/preliminary/\" | relative_url }}). **NOTE:** In this topic, students can try their knowledge of accessibility principles and standards. Accessibility evaluation is beyond the scope of this module. It requires more skills and accessibility knowledge than has been taught so far. #### Learning Outcomes Students should be able to: * Identify potential accessibility barriers. * Relate their findings to the relevant WCAG success criteria. #### Teaching Ideas Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes. * Introduce students to basic accessibility checks. Anyone using the web can perform these checks. Note that the tools listed in Easy Checks are advisable but not required to perform the checks. * Ask students to check different types of web pages and relate their findings to the accessibility principles and standards. #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge Optional ideas to support assessment: * Guided Quiz &mdash; From a given set of accessibility checks, students explain which principle(s) and success criteria they belong to. For example, students select the check Page Titles and attach it to the principle Operable. Assess students' capacity to relate some checks with their corresponding principle(s). * Practice &mdash; Students choose three accessibility checks from [Easy Checks]({{ \"/test-evaluate/preliminary/\" | relative_url }}). Students try the checks on several web pages and report results. Assess students' capacity to relate the checks to specific groups of users and point to solutions for the problems they found in the analyzed websites. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} ## Ideas to Assess Knowledge Optional ideas to support assessment: * Presentation &mdash; Students explain the POUR principles of web accessibility and refer to specifics. For example, students elaborate on setting the language of a web page, under the principle Understandable. * Short Answer questions &mdash; From specific examples of accessibility features, students identify which principle they belong to and which users it helps. For example, \"functionality is available from the keyboard\" belongs to the principle Operable and helps keyboard users as well as people using speech recognition software. * Concept Map &mdash; Students relate the principles of accessible design to web content, authoring tools, and user agents. * Report &mdash; Students summarize the scope of the W3C accessibility standards and explain some of their guidelines and success criteria. * Practice &mdash; Students carry out basic accessibility evaluation. ## Teaching Resources Suggested resources to support your teaching: * [Accessibility Principles]({{ \"/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; Introduces accessibility concepts for websites, web applications, browsers, and other tools. * [W3C Accessibility Standards Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; Introduces standards related to web accessibility for W3C.

Demonstrate how assistive technologies rely on clearly identifiable sections and regions. Explain how content that is dynamically generated, for example through JavaScript, needs to be properly reflected in the DOM. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * explain how structures and semantics enable people with disabilities to orient themselves and navigate within applications * ensure that applications and dynamically generated content have appropriate markup structures and semantics, including: * sections, regions, and corresponding identifiers for these * sections of content, such as lists, paragraphs, and tables * widgets, including menu bars, form controls, and custom widgets * identify and write code for any relationships between different sections of content within the application, for example groups of widgets that share the same purpose * ensure that the order of content within the application follows a meaningful sequence in the DOM and visually, including when content is added, removed, hidden, and displayed * ensure recognizable and consistent naming of widgets, including widget states, in particular when they appear multiple times within an application * describe the impact of large amounts of client side code on assistive technologies and older computer technologies that some people with disabilities may be using * describe related requirements for content authors and designers to provide clear layout and designs that support different viewport sizes #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Demonstrate navigation between several widgets in an application using assistive technologies, such as text-to-speech and voice interaction. Explain how these components show and hide depending on user action. For example, when the user goes to the menu bar, the main text area, or a toolbar, another application widget may be hidden or greyed out. Emphasize that these states need to be programmatically marked up by updating, adding, and removing the corresponding elements from the DOM. * Demonstrate the use of voice commands, keystrokes, and gestures provided by assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to query for applications titles, headings, and regions. Explain that such elements need to be updated using DOM management techniques to reflect the current state of the application, such as when a new view has been selected. * Demonstrate overall interaction with rich applications using assistive technologies. Compare examples where assistive technologies communicate the elements that are displayed with other examples where assistive technologies may access information that is not currently on screen. Emphasize that document object model layers should be added and removed depending on the application view, so that assistive technologies only access the ones that are visible. * Discuss different mechanisms to hide content from view, from the accessibility tree, and from both, such as the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden`, the HTML attribute `hidden`, and the CSS property `display:none`. Explain that code needs to reflect the current state of each of the application widgets. #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practical &mdash; Give students a rich application containing different views and ask students to code mechanisms to update titles, headings, and regions depending on the currently visible section. Assess students' knowledge of how to code updates for application structural components. * Practical &mdash; Give students a rich application containing different views that show and hide based on user interaction and ask students to update the DOM structure accordingly. Assess students' knowledge of how to provide a coherent DOM structure depending on the displayed application widgets. * Practical &mdash; Give students an application with content that can be shown to and hidden from the user; for example, an application to create presentation slides. Ask students to ensure that the code reflects the shown and hidden states of the content; for example, by using the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden`, the HTML attribute `hidden`, and the CSS property `display: none`. Assess students' knowledge of how to code `displayed` and `hidden` states of application views. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: Keyboard and Focus Interactions {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Build on the [Topic Keyboard and Focus Management in Module 6]({{ \"/curricula/custom-widgets/\" | relative_url }}#topic-keyboard-and-focus-management) to extend the concept to entire applications with multiple widgets. Demonstrate the importance of consistent keyboard commands and predictable behavior across the entire application. Explain how change of screens in Single Page Applications (SPA) and modal dialogs require particular focus management. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * explain how people with different types of disabilities interact with widgets, including keyboard only and voice interaction users, and how keyboard commands, including tab, arrow, and shortcut keys, are used to operate widgets * explain how people with different types of disabilities rely on focus indicators that are provided in the code and visually * write code to enable applications to be operated using the keyboard only and other input devices, such as voice interaction * ensure consistent use of keyboard commands, including tab, arrow, and shortcut keys, across the entire application * ensure that navigating through different parts of the application does not initiate change of context without prior notice * ensure that the focus is placed appropriately when new screens are generated in Single Page Applications (SPA); for example, at the beginning of the content to replicate the behavior of page reloads for assistive technologies * ensure that the focus is placed appropriately when inline error messages are generated for application form controls * write code to place focus in modal dialogs at the beginning of the dialog, to confine focus to the dialog until it is closed, and to return the focus to the appropriate place in the main content after the dialog is closed * identify when changes in applications, such as adding, removing, and updating content, impact the current focus and sequence of content, and write code to restore appropriate focus and meaningful sequence when such changes occur * describe related requirements for content authors and designers to provide distinguishable styles for focus indicators #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Explain that the tab sequence needs to be preserved so that keyboard users can navigate across the different widgets and content areas of applications, such as different toolbars and menus. Emphasize that native HTML elements are recommended regardless of the nature of the application in use, as they inherit all the necessary semantic properties that make them usable with the keyboard. * Demonstrate use of common shortcut keys for rich applications, such as to create a new message in a web-based email client or to move to the menu bar in a web-based word processor. Explain that these shortcut keys should avoid any conflict with key combinations of both browsers and assistive technologies. Emphasize that application functionality should rely as much as possible on standard keyboard conventions and on expected navigational mechanisms, as non-standard keyboard shortcuts may sometimes be difficult to remember for some users or impossible to use due to their specific configurations. * Demonstrate assistive technology interaction with rich applications such as Single Page Applications (SPA). Explain that assistive technologies may not perceive content changes by default unless there is a page reload. Emphasize that each time the view changes, a message indicating the currently selected view should be provided to assistive technologies via a live region. * Explain techniques to set focus to the most relevant place in an application, such as a newly loaded screen, a form control containing input errors, the default button in a dialog, and the control that originated a modal dialog. Mention that coding keyboard and focus interactions is a developer's responsibility, whereas defining such interactions is a responsibility shared with the designer. * Demonstrate the use of mechanisms to communicate information about the available keyboard shortcuts in rich applications, such as web-based email clients, spreadsheets, and word processors. Explain that when an application makes extensive use of non-standard keyboard shortcuts, a mechanism that provides users with information about these shortcuts is necessary. Mention that coding these messages is a developer's responsibility, whereas providing them is a responsibility shared with the designer. * Demonstrate accessible and inaccessible modal dialogs. Emphasize how focus remains within the boundaries of the dialogs when they have been coded appropriately. Explain that content that is not part of the modal dialog should not be focusable as long as the modal dialog is displayed. #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practical &mdash; Give students a Single Page Application (SPA) with several screens that show and hide based on user interaction. Ask students to set focus to the specific displayed widget. Assess students' knowledge of how to place focus on a specific application widget based on its state or relevance. * Practical &mdash; Give students an application that makes extensive use of non-standard keyboard shortcuts and ask students to code a help widget that explains such keyboard shortcuts. Assess students' knowledge of how to provide specific help based on the implemented application keyboard shortcuts. * Practical &mdash; Give students an application containing modal dialogs and ask students to set focus to the most relevant place based on user interaction. Assess students' knowledge of how to set focus to the dialog when it appears and to the element that originated it when it disappears. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: Concurrent Notifications {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Build on the [Topic: Notifications in Module 5]({{ \"/curricula/developer-modules/forms/\" | relative_url }}#topic-notifications) to extend the concept to entire applications with multiple widgets. Explain how notifications from different parts of the application need to be queued and prioritized to avoid overloading and confusing users. Demonstrate how unobtrusive and coordinated notifications benefit people using different types of assistive technologies. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * explain how multiple concurrent notifications could occur in applications and describe ways to prioritize such notifications * identify and write code for the appropriate values `polite`, `assertive`, and `off` for WAI-ARIA `aria-live` regions across entire applications * identify and write code for relevant updates using the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-relevant` with the values `additions`, `removals`, and `all` * identify and write code for status messages that may originate from any particular widget or part of the application using the WAI-ARIA `role=\"status\"` * write code for alerts using WAI-ARIA `role=\"alert\"` and identify situations in which it is appropriate to interrupt users * write code for messages containing non-essential information using the WAI-ARIA `role=\"log\"`, and `role=\"marquee\"`, * write code for numerical counters using the WAI-ARIA `role=\"timer\"` * write code to switch notifications on and off to avoid conflicts with assistive technologies presenting several notifications at the same time * describe related requirements for content authors and designers to provide clear and concise notifications #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Demonstrate interaction to request data from applications, such as making a data request for new emails and operating an address lookup. Explain that these data exchanges could be skipped by users of assistive technologies if they are not marked up correctly. Emphasize that live regions to indicate that new data is being loaded and that there is a waiting time should be provided so that users are aware of what is going on. * Compare accessible and inaccessible examples of applications confirmation messages warning about critical errors that can cause data loss, and progress bars indicating timeouts. Explain that, when these messages are populated, these should be given high priority in the list of the live regions so that users can take action to avoid data loss and to solve the problem. #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practical &mdash; Ask students to code an alert to prevent users from quitting a word processor without saving changes. Assess students' knowledge of how to use assertive live regions to provide such alerts. * Practical &mdash; Give students a Single Page Application (SPA) with several views and ask students to code the messages for assistive technologies to indicate what is the currently loaded view. Assess students' knowledge of how to use polite live regions to provide individual notifications based on the currently selected application view {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} ## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practical &mdash; Supervise students using different mechanisms that assistive technologies provide to navigate within rich applications, such as move through headings, regions, and interact with updates and notifications. Assess students’ knowledge of mechanisms of assistive technologies to interact and operate rich applications. * Portfolio &mdash; Students build an accessible single page application. Assess students' knowledge of how to communicate structural elements state changes, keyboard and focus interactions, notifications, and updates to assistive technologies. ## Teaching Resources Suggested resources to support your teaching: * [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) &mdash; Provides readers with an understanding of how to use WAI-ARIA 1.1 to create accessible rich internet applications. * [How People with Disabilities Use the Web]({{ \"/people-use-web/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; Provides stories of people with disabilities using the Web; describes types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies that some people use. * [Notifications and Feedback (Web Accessibility Perspectives)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/notifications/) &mdash; Is one of the Web accessibility perspectives videos that show accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities. * [Keyboard Compatibility (Web Accessibility Perspectives)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/keyboard/) &mdash; Is one of the Web accessibility perspectives videos that show accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities. * [Text to Speech (Web Accessibility Perspectives)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/speech/) &mdash; Is one of the Web accessibility perspectives videos that show accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities. * [Clear Layout and Design (Web Accessibility Perspectives)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/layout/) &mdash; Is one of the Web accessibility perspectives videos that show accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities. * [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) &mdash; Address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. * [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) &mdash; Describes the roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements and can be used to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications. * [HTML5 living standard {% include_cached icon.html name=\"external-link\" %}](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) &mdash; The core markup language for the web. * [DOM Living Standard {% include_cached icon.html name=\"external-link\" %}](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/)",

For many people who are Deaf, sign language is their native language, and some do not understand written language well. This page helps you understand and create sign language interpretation for audio and video. (Sign language is not required by most policies.) {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::nomarkdown} {% include toc.html type=\"start\" title=\"Page Contents\" %} {:/} - This will be replaced by an automatically generated TOC when using Markdown formatting. {::options toc_levels=\"2,3\" /} {:toc} {::nomarkdown} {% include toc.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Introduction {% include image.html src=\"signing-person.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"normal right\" %} Sign languages use hand and arm movements, facial expressions, and body positions to convey meaning. Sign language is the native language of many people who are Deaf. Some do not read or understand written language well &mdash; especially at the speed of most captions. Some people will want to have sign language and captions at the same time. Not everyone who is Deaf knows sign language, especially if they became Deaf or hard-of-hearing later in life. Some people use \"lip reading\" to help understand speech, though that cannot be replied upon for accessibility. Sign languages are different across regions and countries. For example, American Sign Language (ASL), Black American Sign Language (BASL), British Sign Language (BSL), and Auslan (Australian Sign Language) are different. There are some efforts to provide automatic sign language from text; however, avatars that simulate sign language interpretation are not robust enough to be adequate. ## Standards Requirements Sign language is not required in most web accessibility policies. Sign language is in the WCAG standard at Level AAA: [Understanding 1.2.6 Sign Language](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/sign-language-prerecorded.html). _(The Planning page of this resource introduces the [WCAG Standard]({{ \"/media/av/planning/\" | relative_url }}#wcag-standard).)_ ## Skills and Tools To include sign language alternatives, you will need people, skills, and tools to: * do the sign language interpretation * record it * edit it with the audio or video file ## Example Example sign language in video: [NHS 111 British Sign Language (BSL) Advert (YouTube){% include image.html src=\"sign-example.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"large video\" %}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCq3ru9HQSc) ## Creating Sign Language Alternatives Use colors that are easy to distinguish - _planning, recording_ : Usually it is best if the background and the signer’s clothing are solid colors that contrast with their skin tone. That way their hands and face are easier to see. Use good lighting - _planning, recording_ : Ensure good lighting to help make the signer clearly visible. Capture the full signing space - _recording_ : For most sign languages the signing space extends from well below the waist to above the head and at least an elbow width to each side. Ensure the signer is large enough - _post-production_ : Viewers need to be able to clearly see all movements and facial expressions. Avoid obscuring important content - _post-production_ : Position the signer to avoid obscuring important information in the video. The signer is usually at the bottom right. If your video has information such as a news ticker at the bottom, position the signer above that. : Ideally when the video was made, the position of the signer was planned for, as noted in another page of this resource: [Plan for sign language – storyboarding, recording]({{ \"/media/av/av-content/\" | relative_url }}#plan-for-sign-language--storyboarding-recording). Make sign language video(s) easy to discover and use : Make it easy to get to the video with sign language and to the video without sign language. : For example, directly underneath the media player, include a large visible toggle button and/or labelled image for the sign language videos(s). {:.paragraph-like} There are resources on the web that provide additional guidance on creating sign language alternatives.

Explain the use of HTML elements to mark up such tables, including table headers and table cells. Demonstrate how this markup allows the table to be presented in different ways by browsers and assistive technologies. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * explain how table markup allows assistive technologies, such as text-to-speech, to associate information in header and data cells * explain how table markup supports adaptive strategies, such as displaying tables using custom style sheets and on different screen sizes * identify tables that present data and write markup for such data tables using the HTML element `table` * identify and write markup for table headers using the HTML element `th` * identify and write markup for table data cells using the HTML element `td` * identify tables that are used for layout purposes rather than to present data, and write code for such layout using CSS techniques instead of using HTML structures #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Define simple tables as those that contain one row or column header. Explain that speech technologies can associate information in the header and data cells if they are marked up appropriately. Examples of simple tables are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Tables with one header](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/one-header/). * Show examples of use of the HTML elements `table`, `th`, and `td`. Explain that `table` is used to mark up the table layer, `th` is used to code header cells, and `td` is used to code data cells. For examples of how to mark up a simple table, refer to technique [H51: Using table markup to present tabular data](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H51). * Demonstrate the use of voice commands, keystrokes, and gestures provided by assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to navigate tables, including moving between header and data cells. Explore advanced functionality that some tools provide, such as presenting tables as linear information. Examples of how people with disabilities interact with the web are provided in [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/). * Provide examples of alternative renderings for tables, such as splitting the table into several lists, or showing only parts of the table in a mobile viewport. * Explain why layout tables should be avoided, and CSS techniques for visual design should be used instead. Mention that, if a layout table still needs to be used, marking up the table element using `role=\"presentation\"` will help assistive technologies present the information contained in the layout table without the table semantics. #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Short Answer Questions &mdash; Ask students which HTML elements are needed to mark up a simple table structure. Assess students' knowledge of the HTML elements `table`, `th`, and `td`. * Practical &mdash; Give students a simple table and ask students to identify the table headers and to code them using the `th` element. Assess students’ understanding of the `th` element. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: Complex Tables {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Complex tables have multiple or irregular row or column headers. Build on the prior topic Simple Tables to explain the use of additional techniques to convey structure and layout for complex tables. This includes the HTML elements `col` and `colgroup`, the HTML attributes `scope` and `headers`, and the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-sort`. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * identify and write markup for the direction of table headers using the HTML attribute `scope` * identify and write markup for headers that span several columns using the HTML elements `col` and `colgroup` * identify and write markup for headers that span several rows using the HTML elements `row` and `rowgroup` * identify and write markup for table parts using the HTML elements `thead`, `tbody`, and `tfoot` * write code to convey irregular headers for cells using the HTML attribute `headers` * write code for headers that allow for data sorting using the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-sort` with the values `ascending`, `descending`, `other`, and `none` * write code that allows users to operate sorting functionality using different input methods, including keyboard only and voice interaction * describe related requirements for content authors and designers to provide simpler presentation of information when possible, such as splitting complex tables into simple tables that are easier to understand #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Explain that complex tables have multiple or irregular column or row headers. Indicate that assistive technologies may not interpret the direction and scope of such headers, so that it is necessary to provide additional markup to explicitly associate header and data cells. * Demonstrate the use of the HTML attribute `scope` and its values `row`, `col`, `rowgroup`, and `colgroup`, to code the direction of the headers. Explain that these values indicate headers for row, column, group of rows, and group of columns respectively. Examples of how to use the HTML attribute `scope` are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Tables with two headers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/two-headers/). * Show examples of headers that span multiple rows or columns. Explain how to code them using the HTML elements `col`, `colgroup`, `thead` and `tbody`, as well as the attributes `colspan`, `rowspan`, and `rowgroup`. Examples of how to code headers that span several rows or columns are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Tables with irregular headers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/irregular/). * Show examples of uses of the `headers` attribute together with unique identifiers to associate more than two headers that relate to the same data cell. Explain that the identifiers of the corresponding header cells need to be separated by spaces in the value of the attribute `headers`. Examples of how to use the `headers` attribute are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Tables with multi-level headers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/multi-level/). * Show examples of sortable tables. Explain that the component that allows to sort the data is usually coded as a button so that it can be used with different input methods. Emphasize that additional feedback may need to be provided based on the support for the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-sort`, so that users are aware of how data is currently sorted. Examples of how to provide sortable tables are provided in the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices [Data grid example 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/grid/dataGrids.html). #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Short answer questions &mdash; Ask students how table headers that span several rows or columns are coded in HTML. Assess students' knowledge of the HTML elements to code multiple row and column headers. * Practical &mdash; Give students a table containing headers that span several columns or rows and ask students to code them. Assess how students use the HTML elements `th`, `col`, `tbody`, and the attribute `scope` to indicate the scope of the table headers and convey their direction. * Practical &mdash; Give students an irregular table and ask students to code its headers using the attribute `headers`. Assess how students use the attribute `headers` and its corresponding identifiers in data cells. * Practical &mdash; Give students a sortable table and ask students to code it. Assess students' knowledge of how to use `aria-sort` and functionality that allows to sort data using different input methods. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: Table Descriptions {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Explain the use of HTML elements and, if necessary, WAI-ARIA attributes to provide information about the purpose of a table. Mention that these descriptions for tables are typically provided by content authors. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * write markup for table descriptions using the HTML element `caption` * identify situations in which it is necessary to use other techniques to provide table descriptions, and write markup for table descriptions using the following techniques as appropriate: * WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` * HTML elements `figure` and `figcaption` * HTML attribute `summary` (recommended for fallback purposes) * describe related requirements for content authors to write meaningful table summaries and descriptions #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Show examples of use of the HTML element `caption` to provide descriptions for the purpose of a table. Mention that it needs to be the first child of the element `table` and that its contents are visible for all users by default. Examples of how to use the element `caption` are provided in technique [H39: Using caption elements to associate data table captions with data tables](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H39). * Explain the use of methods to provide further details about the structure and contents of a table. For example, the HTML elements `figure` and `figcaption`, and the WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby`. Explain that the element `table` needs to be wrapped by the element `figure`, and that the element `figcaption` containing the text needs to be the first child of the element `figure`. Examples of how to code a table summary are provided in the WAI tutorials on [Caption and summary](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/caption-summary/). * Explain the use of the attribute `summary` to provide people using a screen reader with detailed information about the structure of complex tables. Emphasize that it is obsolete according to the HTML5 specification. Its usage is only advisable for fallback purposes. Newer techniques (discussed above on this topic) are recommended. Examples of how to use the attribute `summary` are provided in technique [H73: Using the summary attribute of the table element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H73). #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practical &mdash; Give students a table and ask students to provide mechanisms for authors to add a short text to describe its purpose. Assess students' understanding of the `caption` element to describe the purpose of a table. * Practical &mdash; Give students a complex table and ask students to include mechanisms for authors to provide extended details about its contents and overall structure. Assess students' knowledge of HTML elements and attributes to provide table summaries. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"all\" %} ## Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Module Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practical &mdash; Supervise students using mechanisms that assistive technologies provide to move to next and previous table, to move between table cells, and to show all the tables of a web page in an isolated list. Assess students’ knowledge of mechanisms of assistive technologies to move through table content and between tables. * Short Answer Questions &mdash; Direct students to a web page where there are several tables. Then ask students to use an accessibility evaluation extension to find all table header and data cells and to compare these with the visual structure of the tables. Assess how students analyze if a table is coded appropriately to reflect its structure. * Practical &mdash; Give students a table with neither visual nor programmatic headers. Then ask students to figure out the table headers and decide if the table could be considered simple or complex. Assess how students identify table headers and distinguish between simple and complex tables. * Portfolio &mdash; Students add tables to the website they are building. Assess how students code table headers and table cells, as well as how they provide a table caption and additional descriptions for tables. ## Teaching Resources Suggested resources to support your teaching: * [Tables (WAI Web Accessibility Tutorials)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/) &mdash; Shows how to develop tables that are accessible to people with disabilities. * [How People with Disabilities Use the Web]({{ \"/people-use-web/\" | relative_url }}) &mdash; Provides stories of people with disabilities using the Web; describes types of disabilities and some of the barriers that people encounter using the Web; and introduces types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies that some people use. * [Text to Speech (Web Accessibility Perspectives)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/speech/) &mdash; Is one of the Web accessibility perspectives videos that show accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities. * [Clear Layout and Design (Web Accessibility Perspectives)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/layout/) &mdash; Is one of the Web accessibility perspectives videos that show accessibility features and how they impact people with disabilities. * [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) &mdash; Address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. * [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) &mdash; Describes the roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements and can be used to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications. * [HTML5 living standard {% include_cached icon.html name=\"external-link\" %}](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) &mdash; The core markup language for the web.",

It's more art than science — for example, it’s not always clear which non-speech audio information to include and how to communicate it in text. If you have the resources to hire professionals to do your transcribing, that is best. If you don't, please don't be deterred from providing transcripts or captions. This page helps you do it yourself (DIY). In some cases, there is already text available in a script. You'll probably need to make some minor edits so it's accurate with the final audio content. ## How to Transcribe You can just listen to the audio and type it up. That's usually pretty tedious because you have to stop and restart the audio a lot. There is software that can help by slowing down the audio and providing easy pause buttons. You can start with an automatically-generated text file. There's lots of software and services that provide speech-to-text. These have various levels of accuracy. Often the text does not match the spoken audio — and in ways that change the meaning (or are embarrassing). For example, missing just one word such as “not” can make the captions contradict the actual audio content. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Example of bad automatic captions (that cause a fire)\" class=\"simple aside\" %} {:/} {% include image.html src=\"food-fire.jpg\" alt=\"food on fire under broiler\" class=\"normal right\" %} _Spoken text:_&quot;Broil on high for 4 to 5 minutes. You should not preheat the oven.&quot; _Automatic caption:_&quot;Broil on high for 45 minutes. You should know to preheat the oven.&quot; {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} Plan to spend time correcting automatically-generated transcription. More details on options and tools for transcribing are in: Transcripts on the Web, [How to get or make transcripts {% include_cached external.html %}](http://www.uiaccess.com/transcripts/transcripts_on_the_web.html#justdoit). A little about captioning tools is in the Captions/Subtitles page of this resource: [Captioning Tools]({{ \"/media/av/captions/\" | relative_url }}#caption-tools). ## What to Transcribe Generally, you transcribe all speech and relevant non-speech sound (such as: baby cries, fireworks going off, horse hoofs approaching). Keep in mind that the main purpose is to **provide the information that you hear to people who cannot hear the audio**. That will help you know which sounds to transcribe, and which are not needed. The following are common practices, not requirements. ### Basics * **Identify the speakers** as relevant. Often it is best to use the full name the first time and single name throughout &mdash; either first/given or last/family depending on the formality. * You can **include relevant information about the speech**. For example: ( between gritted teeth ): I hate this computer! * Put **non-speech sounds** in parentheses, lowercase, italics, with a space before and after. For example: ( computer crashing into bits and parts sliding across the floor ) * When a **speaker is off-screen**, you can put their speech in italics. For example: Jose: What was that awful noise? Zoe: You don't want to know. Jose: Well, I'm coming to find out. * **Only include background music if** it's important to understand the content of the video. Use objective descriptions that indicate the mood; avoid subjective words, such as \"beautiful.\" If the words in the music are important, add a musical note to the beginning and end of each caption. Put music information in italics. For example: ♪ scary music, JAWS theme ♪ * Do not emphasize a word using **all capital letters**, except to indicate yelling. For example: Jose: YOU KILLED MY NEW LAPTOP! ### Transcribe Accurately and Honestly * **Do not change or adapt or add to the text**. Transcribe what is said accurately. * For example, it is usually not appropriate to correct grammar or other mistakes. * Do not censor. For example, if objectionable words are said, include those in the captions. If the audio is edited to obscure a phrase (e.g., \"bleeped\" audio), reflect that in the captions, e.g., --bleep-- * Do not provide additional clarifying information in the captions. (You can provide some in the transcript as appropriate.) * Include the appropriate level of detail: * For some content, such as legal depositions, transcribe everything verbatim, including things like \"um\", \"ah\", and repeated phrases. * For most web content, it is acceptable to leave out non-substantive text to make the captions easier to process &mdash; while adhering to the tips above. For example, if the speaker says: I just got so frustrated (cough, cough) sorry – uhhh what was I saying?..., oh yea - I got so frustrated with my computer. You can caption: I just got so frustrated with my computer. * If there is speech that is not at all relevant, indicate that it has been excluded from the captions. For example: [participants discuss the weather while the presenter reboots his computer] * If you cannot understand what is said, transcribe: [unintelligible] ## More on Captions For captions: * Captions are one or two lines. Generally is is best to keep them under 32 characters per line. * Put a new sentence on a new line. * If you need to break a sentence into multiple segments, break it at a logical phrase. Captions also include the time that each phrase will be displayed. Most people use tools to develop and refine captions.

In some cases, transcripts are not required to meet WCAG standards. _(The Planning page of this resource introduces the [WCAG Standard]({{ \"/media/av/planning/\" | relative_url }}#wcag-standard).)_ {% capture boxhead %} Audio-only (e.g., podcast): {% endcapture %} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=boxhead class=\"highlighted\" id=\"checklist-ao\" %} {:/} - For pre-recorded: - Transcripts are **_required_** at WCAG Level A. {:.alt} - For live: - Transcripts are at WCAG Level AAA.

(A bit more justification is in the Planning page: [Descriptive Transcripts]({{ \"/media/av/planning/\" | relative_url }}#descriptive-transcripts).) And **descriptive transcripts are easy and inexpensive to make** using captions and audio description that you already have to meet Level AA, as explained on this page. ## Process – Skills and Tools The process for providing transcripts is basically: 1. Get a text version of the audio, called \"transcribing\". 2. Format the transcript. 3. Put the transcript online, and make it easy for users to find the transcript from the audio or video file. ### If You Start with Captions For videos, often transcribing the audio to text is done to create captions, as described in the [captions page]({{ \"/media/av/captions/\" | relative_url }}). Then the captions file is used to create the transcript. Creating transcripts from caption files is easy with basic web skills and tools. ### If You Start with Transcribing Transcribing an audio file takes quite a bit of time for people who don't have the software and skill for it. Many organizations choose to outsource the transcribing. Guidance for doing it yourself (DIY) is in another page of this resource: [Transcribing Audio to Text]({{ \"/media/av/transcribing/\" | relative_url }}). Once you have the transcription, creating the transcript is easy with basic web skills and tools. ## Creating Transcripts If you already have captions, you can use that file to create the transcript. Most caption-editing tools provide an option to export a plain text transcript. Otherwise, you will need to delete the timestamps, or edit them per below. If you don't have captions, you'll need transcription of the audio information. That's addressed in another page of this resource: [Transcribing Audio to Text]({{ \"/media/av/transcribing/\" | relative_url }}). Captions are generally written to be viewed along with the visual video. Transcripts should include important visual infomation for those not seeing the video. When you use captions to create transcripts, **usually you will need to add visual information to the transcript**, such as text that is in the video and speaker identification. ### Transcript File Format Most transcripts on the web are provided in HTML. There is not a set design for transcripts. Different options and examples are described throughout the guidance below. A transcript of a podcast can be simple text paragraphs with the speakers identified. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Example transcript of a podcast interview with two speakers (excerpt)\" class=\"\" %} {:/} Rajwinder Kaur: Welcome to the podcast. Shawn Henry: Thank you for this opportunity to share information about accessibility. Rajwinder: Would you start by telling us a little about your role at W3C? Shawn: I work within the Web Accessibility Initiative, W-A-I, pronounced \"way\". {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} A descriptive transcript can be in a table so that readers can easily read only the audio information down a column if they choose. A [descriptive transcript example is below](#descriptive). {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"\" open=\"true\" %} ### Making Transcripts More Useful {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Keep in mind that the main purpose of a transcript is to provide the information to people who cannot get it from the audio and/or video. That will help you know what to include and how to design it. Add information to make the transcript more useful. For example, add headings, links, a summary, and maybe time stamps, as described below. The following are optional, not requirements. * **Put the information in logical paragraphs, lists, and sections**. If you're starting with a captions file, you will probably combine several lines into paragraphs. For example, in the [example excerpts below](#example-descriptive-transcript-from-caption-files), 6 lines of captions are grouped into 2 paragraphs of text (in table cells). * **Add navigation and clarifications:** * Add headings and links where it will make the transcript more usable. (This also helps with SEO, search engine optimization.) Here's an [example with added links in short podcast transcript](http://www.w3.org/WAI/highlights/200606wcag2interview.html). * It is generally acceptable to add clarifying information, _as long as it is clear that it is not part of the actual audio_ &mdash; for example, words added to a paragraph put in [brackets], or separate sections with headings \"Introduction\", \"Transcript\", \"Resources\". Here's an [example with added headings in long presentation transcript](http://www.w3.org/WAI/highlights/200706wcag2pres). * **Indicate the speakers based on the type of content.** For example: * When there are multiple speakers, you could use hanging indents to make it easy to skim for a particular speaker. * When you want the focus on the interviewee's answers and not the interviewer, you could bold the interviewee's name so it stands out more clearly. * **Include timestamps only when useful.** In many cases, including timestamps would be unnecessary clutter. If you do include them, they usually don't need to be as granular as the captions, and do not need to include end times. * **If starting with captions for video:** The video might have text information that was not included in the captions, for example, the title of the video or the name and title of people speaking. If you also have the description of visual information, it should already be in there. If not, you'll need to review the video and see if there is text visually that wasn't repeated in the captions, and add that to your transcript. ## Where to Put Transcripts Make it is easy for users to know that a transcript is available and to get to the transcript. For example, put the transcript itself or a link to the transcript right under the video. For media on your website, usually it's best to include the transcript on the same page. Here's an [example descriptive transcript at the bottom of same page with a video](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/captions/#transcript). When your media is hosted elsewhere, you might have the transcript on a separate web page. Here's an [example podcast transcript on separate page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/highlights/200606wcag2interview.html). {% include excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"example-descriptive\" %} ## Example Descriptive Transcript from Caption Files {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Below is an example of caption files used to create a descriptive transcript. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Example caption file of audio information (excerpt)\" class=\"\" %} {:/} ``` 00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.240 Video isn't just about pictures, 00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:12.040 it's also about sound. 00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.280 Without the audio, you would have to guess what this film is about. 00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.730 Frustrating isn't it? 00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:26.880 Not knowing what's going on. 00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.840 That's the situation for everyone who can't hear. ``` {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Example caption file of audio description of visual information (excerpt)\" class=\"\" %} {:/} ``` 00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.980 A man sitting at a desk starts watching a video on his computer. 00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.780 The video on his computer shows a person speaking to the camera. 00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.140 It is playing with no audio. 00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.620 The man watching the video has a hearing aid. ``` {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Example descriptive transcript from the caption files above (excerpt)\" class=\"\" %} {:/} Audio Visual Video isn't just about pictures, it's also about sound.

Then you'll know the \"why\" behind the media accessibility requirements in this resource. For example, a person who is Deaf can't hear the audio, so you need to provide important audio information in another form. * Many people who are **Deaf** can read text well. They get the audio information from **transcripts** or **captions**. Some people prefer **sign language**. * Some people who are **hard of hearing** like to listen to the audio to hear what they can, and have **captions** to fill in what they can't hear adequately. * Some people who have **difficulty processing auditory information** also use **captions**. Many use **transcripts** so they can read at their own pace. * Some people who are **blind** or have low vision can't see videos well or at all. They use **audio description of visual information** to understand what's going on visually. * Some people who are **Deaf-blind** use a screen reader and braille to read **descriptive transcripts** that include the audio and visual information as text. * Some people **cannot focus and comprehend auditory or visual information** when there are changing visuals. For most videos, they also need **descriptive transcripts**. * Some people cannot use their hands and **use speech recognition software** to operate their computer, including the **media player**. And people who are **blind** need the media player to work without a mouse. * Some people use multiple accessibility features simultaneously. For example, someone might want captions, description of visual information as text, and description in audio. If you want to learn more, see these other resources: * [How People with Disabilities Use the Web]({{ \"/people-use-web/\" | relative_url }}) * [Media Accessibility User Requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/) * [Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility]({{ \"/planning/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}) ## Used by People With and _Without_ Disabilities {#situations} Accessible media is **essential for people with disabilities**, and is **useful for everyone**. Accessibility features are also used by people _without_ disabilities in a variety of situations. {% include image.html src=\"transcript.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"mini right\" %} For example, transcripts can be: * Skimmed or read rather than watched or listened to. This is significantly easier and quicker for many users. Sometimes people want to skim the transcript first before deciding whether or not to play the media. * Used without needing to download video files. For example, to save data on mobile. * Used offline, printed, or converted to braille. {% include image.html src=\"cc.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"mini right\" %} And captions can be used: * In loud environments where users cannot hear the audio. For example, a bar, an airport, or a concert. * In quiet environments where users cannot turn on sound. For example, in a library, on public transportation, or when others are sleeping. * By people who cannot understand the spoken language well and can understand the written language better. For example, people who are not native speakers of the language. * By people learning to read, including people learning a new language. * To better understand content because users can hear the information in audio and see it in text at the same time. For example, a [Research Study of Closed Captions & Transcripts {% include_cached external.html %}](https://www.3playmedia.com/2019/02/21/8-benefits-of-transcribing-captioning-videos/) found that 71% of students _without_ hearing difficulties use captions, primarily to help them focus and retain information. ## Benefits to Organizations {#benefits} {% include image.html src=\"brand.svg\" alt=\"inclusive, diverse, responsible\" class=\"normal right\" %} Organizations that make their audio and video accessible can realize benefits such as: * Increased traffic and website use by people with and without disabilities, for example, in the [situations described above](#situations). * Better user experience for all and improved customer satisfaction. * Better indexing by search engines. {% include image.html src=\"market-reach.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"small right\" %} Benefits to organizations are illustrated in these other resources: * The business case includes **case study data** from adding transcripts, and more on how accessibility can [increase your market reach](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/#increase-market-reach). * Benefits of transcripts and captions to a university are mentioned in a [**user story/persona** of an online student who is hard of hearing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/#onlinestudent). * Some benefits of captions are illustrated in a 1-minute [**Video** on Captions. {% include image.html src=\"captions-video-still.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"normal video\" %}](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/captions/) This resource helps make your media usable by people with and without disabilities, and benefit your organization.

Involving users in web accessibility. Accessibility is about making your websites and applications usable by people with disabilities. That includes your customers, clients, employees, students, and others. Accessibility. A person in front of a computer. Next to the computer the words: customers; clients; employees; and students. Unfortunately many approach accessibility just as a checklist. This risks missing the real purpose of accessibility - the user experience. A checklist replaces the person. The website on the screen crumbles. 4 people replace the computer and checklist. Involving people with disabilities throughout your design and development process can be more effective and yield better results: designers and developers learn how people with disabilities use the web, and understand assistive technologies and adaptive strategies they use; The group of people are surrounded by icons inserted in a development process cycle: pen icon; coding icon; paintbrush icon; and a magnifying glass icon.

Involving users early helps you implement more effective accessibility solutions. It also broadens your perspective and can lead you to discover new ways of thinking about your product that makes it work better for more people in more situations. This applies when designing and developing: - websites and web applications - browsers, media players, and assistive technologies - authoring tools such as content management systems (CMS), blog software, and WYSIWYG editors - accessibility standards and policies - web technologies and technical specifications, such as HTML This page gets you started reaping the benefits of **involving users — specifically people with disabilities and older people with accessibility needs due to aging — early and throughout different types of projects**. A separate page focuses on [Involving Users in Evaluating Web Accessibility]({{ \"/test-evaluate/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}). How Involving Users Early Helps {#why} --------------------------------------- Involving users early in web projects results in better products for users, more efficient development, and other benefits to project stakeholders. ### Better Accessibility and Better Usability for All Users When developers understand accessibility issues, they can implement **more effective** accessibility solutions. For example, their website will work better and be more usable for people with disabilities, older users, and [other target groups](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/archive/soc#groups). Making websites and web tools more usable for people with a range of disabilities improves general usability for everybody, including people *without* disabilities. (You could say that involving users with disabilities in your development project gives you **improved usability** for free.) This benefits users, and also stakeholders. For example, when websites get [increased use](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/archive/fin#increase-use) and other [business benefits](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/archive/) from increased accessibility. ### More Efficient Development Including users in the development process helps you **more efficiently develop** accessible products that work well for real users in real situations. This can help [maximize your return on investment (ROI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/archive/) in accessibility. When you understand how people use the web and your particular product, you can: - plan accessibility into appropriate project phases from the beginning - more quickly develop accessibility solutions - make informed decisions between different options, and avoid wasting time guessing - limit having to go back and fix problems - avoid having to make compromises later because you waited too long to address accessibility - have a better perspective on accessibility standards, guidelines, and other requirements (which you might need to meet now or later, for example, if you sell to the government) All these benefit developers, project managers, and other stakeholders. ### Motivation When designers and developers see people with disabilities use products like theirs, most are highly motivated by a new understanding of accessibility. They understand the human interaction aspects of accessibility and go beyond approaching accessibility as only a checklist item. Designers and developers can see the opportunity for their work to impact lives. When managers and stakeholders share such experiences of people with disabilities using their products, it often helps get resources budgeted and scheduled to address accessibility well. How to Involve Users throughout Your Project {#range} ------------------------------------------------------ This section focuses on including real people in the process. Address accessibility from the earliest stage of the project. For example, consider accessibility during planning, budgeting, scheduling and such. Include accessibility in your [user-centered design processes (UCD)](http://www.w3.org/WAI/redesign/ucd) or other design methodologies and techniques. For example, ensure that people with disabilities and older users are included in use cases, user analysis, personas, scenarios, workflows, design walkthroughs, etc. Below are the basics that you can do yourself to include users in your projects. If you have the resources, consider getting assistance from accessibility, disability, and user-centered design specialists. ### Including Users to Understand the Issues As early as possible in your project: 1. Learn the basics of [How People with Disabilities Use the Web]( /people-use-web/) by reading online resources and watching videos. 2. Find people with disabilities, with a range of characteristics. See [Getting a Range of Users](#diverse) and [Working with Users](#with) below. 3. Learn about general issues related to the type of product you are developing (website, web application, authoring tool, standard, etc.). Ask people to show you related products that work well for them. Then, ask them to show you problems in products that do not work well. Ask lots of questions to help you understand the accessibility issues. ### Including Users in Implementation For example, for websites, web applications, and web tools: * When you are considering a specific design aspect, such as expanding/collapsing navigation, find other products that are already doing it. Ask users to explore with you what works well and what does not. * Throughout your design and development, ask users to review prototypes. Give them specific tasks to complete and see how the different aspects of the design and coding could be improved. Ask lots of questions. For more in this, see [Involving Users in Evaluating Web Accessibility]({{ \"/test-evaluate/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}), especially the sections on [Analyzing Accessibility Issues]({{ \"/test-evaluate/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}#analyz) and [Drawing Conclusions and Reporting]({{ \"/test-evaluate/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}#drawing). ### Carefully Consider Input Caution: Carefully consider all input. Avoid assuming that input from one person with a disability applies to all people with disabilities. A person with a disability does not necessarily know how other people with the same disability interact with the web. They might not know enough about other disabilities to provide valid guidance on other accessibility issues. Getting input from a range of users is best. Getting a Range of Users {#diverse} ------------------------------------ People with disabilities are as diverse as any people. They have diverse experiences, expectations, and preferences. They use diverse interaction techniques, [adaptive strategies](#strategies){:.termref}, and [assistive technology](#at){:.termref} configurations. People have different disabilities: auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual. Some people have multiple disabilities. Even within one category, there is extreme variation. For example, \"visual disability\" includes people who have been totally blind since birth, people who have distortion in their central vision from age-related degeneration, and people who temporarily have blurry vision from an injury or disease. Include users with a variety of disabilities and [user characteristics](#userchars){:.termref}. Most projects have limited time and budget and cannot include many different users. Selecting the optimum number of users with the best suited characteristics can be difficult. There are resources on the web that provide guidance on selecting participants with disabilities. For example, [determining participant characteristics](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/ut_plan.html#characteristics) and [finding participants with disabilities](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/ut_plan.html#recruiting). ### Users' Experience Interacting with the Web {#experience} A primary consideration in selecting users is their experience interacting with the web. For example, some [assistive technologies](#at){:.termref} (AT) are complicated and difficult to learn. A user with insufficient experience may not know how to use the AT effectively. And a very advanced user might know uncommon work-arounds to overcome problems in a website that the \"average\" user would not be able to handle. In the early stages when you are first learning how people with disabilities interact with the web, it is usually best to get people with a fairly high experience level. ([Involving Users in Evaluating Web Accessibility]({{ \"/test-evaluate/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}) says more about different experience levels in later evaluation phases.) Working with Users {#with} --------------------------- Follow common practices for working with people informally and formally, for example: - Develop appropriate relationships with your users. For example, spending time talking informally over lunch may help you work together more comfortably. - Ensure informed consent and other research ethics. For example, tell participants in studies that they are free to stop at any time. - Treat people with disabilities and older users with the respect you would any other users. For example, respect their time and provide appropriate compensation. There are resources on the web that provide detailed guidance on working with users; for example, [Interacting with People with Disabilities](http://uiaccess.com/accessucd/interact.html), [Assistive Technology and Location](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/involve.html#atloc), and [The RESPECT Code of Practice](http://www.respectproject.org/code/charm.php?id=). Combine User Involvement with Standards ------------------------------------------------ {:#stds} Including users with disabilities and older users with accessibility needs is key to making your accessibility efforts more effective and more efficient. Yet that alone cannot address all issues. Even large projects cannot cover the [diversity](#diverse) of disabilities, adaptive strategies, and assistive technologies. That is **the role of accessibility standards**. - For websites and web applications, using comprehensive standards such as [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}) helps ensure that you address all issues. Combine user involvement with [evaluating conformance to WCAG]({{ \"/test-evaluate/conformance/\" | relative_url }}) to ensure that accessibility is provided to users with a range of disabilities and situations. - For authoring tools such as content management systems (CMS), blog software, and WYSIWYG editors, follow [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/atag/\" | relative_url }}). - For browsers, media players, and other 'user agents', follow [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/uaag/\" | relative_url }}). More Information and Guidance {#fmi} ------------------------------------- This document briefly addresses a few points of a very complex topic. Many resources on other aspects of involving users throughout projects are available on the web, such as: - **[Involving Users in Evaluating Web Accessibility]({{ \"/test-evaluate/involving-users/\" | relative_url }})** provides more details on specifically on evaluation with users. - [Just Ask: Integrating Accessibility Throughout Design](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/overview.html) provides detailed guidance on incorporating accessibility throughout projects. For example, see [Incorporating Accessibility Early and Throughout](http://uiaccess.com/accessucd/early.html). Terminology {#terms} --------------------- **adaptive strategies**{:#strategies} : Adaptive strategies are techniques that people with disabilities use to improve interaction with the web. For example, increasing the font size in a common browser. Adaptive strategies include techniques with mainstream browsers or with [assistive technologies](#at){:.termref}. **assistive technologies**{:#at} : Assistive technologies are software or equipment that people with disabilities use to improve interaction with the web. For example, **screen readers**{:#screenreader} that read aloud web pages for people who cannot read text, **screen magnifiers** for people with some types of low vision, and **voice recognition software** and **selection switches** for people who cannot use a keyboard or mouse. **user characteristics**{:#userchars} : User characteristics typically include things like age, job responsibilities, software, hardware, environment (for example, home, shared office, private office, shared public terminal), computer experience, and web experience. User characteristics can also include type of disability, [adaptive strategies](#strategies){:.termref} used, and experience with specific [assistive technologies](#at){:.termref}. **web content**{:#content} : Web \"content\" generally refers to the information in a web page or web application, including text, images, forms, sounds, and such. More specific definitions are available in the WCAG documents, which are linked from the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}).",

While it is possible for individuals to evaluate Web accessibility effectively if they have training and experience across a broad range of disciplines, it is less likely that one individual will have all the expertise that a collaborative approach can bring.  This document describes:  - recommended expertise for evaluating Web accessibility - approaches for creating collaborative evaluation processes - considerations for effective collaboration in different settings References to related evaluation resources are mentioned throughout this document. Most of these resources can be found in, [Evaluating Web Accessibility Overview](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/Overview). ## Recommended Expertise {:#expertise} Effective evaluation of Web accessibility requires more than simply running an evaluation tool on a Web site. Comprehensive and effective evaluations require evaluators with an understanding of Web technologies, evaluation tools, barriers that people with disabilities experience, assistive technologies and approaches that people with disabilities use, and accessibility guidelines and techniques. The following list includes recommended expertise across a variety of areas, and provides links to initial resources, listed in the [Appendix](#appendix) at the end of this document, which may be useful in learning more about those areas.  - Web technologies - Validation tools for Web technologies - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and Techniques - Approaches for evaluating Web accessibility - Use of a variety of evaluation tools for Web site accessibility - Disability barriers, assistive technologies, and adaptive strategies - Involvement of people with disabilities in evaluation Approaches for Collaborative Evaluation {:#composition} When first conducting a Web accessibility evaluation, the initial approach in many organizations is to assign the task to an individual within the organization, or to outsource it. However, many organizations use a collaborative evaluation process involving the skills and perspectives of multiple evaluators. This approach allows an organization to use in-house expertise as well as outside experts where needed. Collaborative evaluation processes can involve: - a group of colleagues distributed within a larger organization; for instance, Web developers from different units of a large corporation working together - a Web development or quality assurance team within a larger organization, which brings in outside experts to help them conduct evaluations in the short term and helps them build improved capability for in-house evaluation over the long term - a small business whose mission is to provide accessibility evaluation services, and which does so with a multi-disciplinary team - disability advocates from different organizations who collaborate in online fora to monitor accessibility of Web sites - a group of individuals distributed across related organizations such as government agencies, each with the obligation to monitor accessibility of their own Web site, who combine their diverse expertise & perspectives for higher quality evaluations Considerations in Combining Expertise {:#operation} ### Centralized versus distributed evaluation capability Organizations with in-house evaluation capacity sometimes use a centralized group of evaluators, and sometimes use evaluators who are distributed across the organization. A centralized team can serve as a resource for the rest of the organization. Evaluation capability that is distributed across an organization may offer more possibilities for integrating accessibility work into Web development processes throughout the organization. It may help in identifying more diverse expertise since one can look beyond the boundaries of a centralized team. In addition, it can help in developing a shared organizational mission for continual improvement of accessibility, rather than leaving oversight of accessibility as the responsibility of a single office. ### Identification of external expertise Once gaps in internal expertise are clear, an organization can prioritize its needs for external expertise. The internal gaps are often in areas of knowledge specific to disability and/or accessibility; for instance, Web accessibility guidelines, cross-disability accessibility barriers, or use of assistive technologies. In addition, even organizations with established user testing processes may need guidance on how to get feedback from users with disabilities. It can be valuable in some cases to bring in more than one outside expert to cover this range of issues effectively, or to look for feedback in online communities focusing on Web accessibility. ### Involving users in evaluation Inclusion of people with disabilities in a collaborative group can contribute to a better understanding of accessibility issues within the organization, and/or to maintaining awareness of the urgency of addressing accessibility barriers on a site, in addition to their individual technical contributions to the evaluation. Regardless of the collective expertise of a collaborative group of evaluators in conducting conformance evaluations, an organization may want to ensure periodic review by users with a variety of disabilities. There are many factors to consider in effectively [involving users in Web accessibility evaluations]({{ \"/test-evaluate/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}), including ensuring diversity in disabilities represented, types of assistive technology used, and experience with the Web. ### Facilitating collaboration through shared tools and templates A group of evaluators may want to arrange for shared access to certain evaluation tools, or to ensure that they have access to a [broad range of evaluation tools](http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html) across the group as a whole. Using an agreed-upon template for reporting the results of evaluations can greatly facilitate coordination between different evaluators. Such a template might be an adaptation of the [Template for Accessibility Evaluation Reports](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/template.html). ### Communicating results Collaborative teams may want to give particular attention to communicating the results of their evaluations to their customers clearly, since their reports represent the combined perspectives of different evaluators.  ### Getting and giving feedback Providing a mechanism for feedback within an organization on the usefulness of the evaluation process and resulting report may assist collaborative evaluators in ongoing identification of gaps in expertise, and contribute to long-term improvement in the quality of evaluations. Feedback from experienced groups of evaluators on evaluation resources such as W3C/WAI's resources in [Evaluating Web Accessibility Overview](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/Overview) can, over time, also help improve the quality of evaluation support resources available to the broader Web community. Feedback links are available in the footers of pages in this Evaluation resource suite. ## Appendix This appendix includes links to resources related to key areas of expertise needed for Web accessibility evaluation. - {:#webtechs} Web technologies - [W3C Specifications and Standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/) - {:#wcag} Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and Techniques - [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}) - [How to Meet WCAG (Quick Reference)](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/) - [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) - {:#techs} [Techniques for WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/) - {:#approacheval} Approaches for evaluating web accessibility - [Evaluating Web Accessibility Overview](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/Overview) - {:#evaltools} Use of a variety of evaluation tools for Web site accessibility - [Selecting Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/selectingtools.html) - [Evaluation Tools for Web Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html#Evaluation) - {:#barriers} Disability barriers and assistive technologies and adaptive strategies - [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web) - {:#involveusers} Involvement of people with disabilities in evaluation - [Involving Users in Web Accessibility Evaluation]({{ \"/test-evaluate/involving-users/\" | relative_url }})",

Contact organizations when you find accessibility barriers on their website. Your feedback to an organization can help them improve their website's accessibility. This will benefit you, other people who use the website, and the organization itself. Website owners have many priorities for changes and improvements. The more an organization hears about accessibility from people who use their website, the more likely it is that accessibility will become a higher priority. [Positive feedback](#encourage) is useful, as well as critical feedback. Some website owners are not even aware of the importance of making their website accessible. Websites are required to be accessible in many countries by [national policies]({{ \"/policies/\" | relative_url }}). The [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html) states that people with disabilities have a right to access information and services via the Internet. Also, accessible websites provide [business benefits](/WAI/bcase/) for website owners and [benefits for people without disabilities](/WAI/bcase/soc.html#groups). Note that most accessibility barriers are caused by poor website design and development. However, some accessibility problems might be related to settings in your web browser or assistive technology. For guidance to help you customize your particular web browser and computer setup so it's easier to use websites, see [Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your Computer](https://www.w3.org/WAI/users/browsing.html). ## Consider Your Approach {#approach} Consider what approach will get the results you want. Your tone in emails, phone calls, and other communications influences how people react and respond. Keep in mind that there are different reasons why websites are not accessible. Some organizations don't know about accessibility and don’t know how to make their websites accessible. Some are just learning about accessibility and trying to make their website accessible, although they might not be doing it well enough yet. And there are some organizations that choose not to make their websites accessible. Often it is best when you first contact an organization to assume that they don’t know about the accessibility barriers on their website. You can adjust your approach based on their response and what you learn about the organization's position on accessibility. Their response can help you choose follow up actions that are likely to be most effective. ### Asking Others to Help {#ask} Consider asking friends, family, or colleagues for help understanding the problem you are observing and communicating it to the website owner. For example, the issue may be related to the website or any assistive technologies you are using. You can also ask other to help you communicate with the website owner. For example, an advocacy group. ### Encouraging Accessible Websites {#encourage} Acknowledge and encourage organizations that make an effort to be accessible. Positive feedback can motivate individuals and organizations. It can encourage other organizations to invest in web accessibility. ## Identify Key Contacts {#contact} Try to find the person responsible for the web page or application that is inaccessible. Or find the person responsible for accessibility at the organization. Sometimes you will have to use any contact you can find. Look for links on their website such as: * Accessibility * Editor, Author, Page Owner, Webmaster * Contact Us, Feedback, Comments * Help, Support, Customer Service, “FAQ” (frequently asked questions) Some links will be email addresses, some will go to online forms, and some will provide other ways to contact the organization. If you cannot find contacts on the website, other places to look include: * telephone directory * local library and librarian * local business directory * public companies register ## Describe the Problem {#report} Describe the accessibility barrier clearly. This will help the organization find and fix the problem. Include: * the page where you found a problem * what the problem is that you observe * what computer and software you use * a screenshot of the web page ### Where the Problem is {#where} Include the web address (also called URL), or a description of the page. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Examples of a web address (URL):\" class=\"example\" %} {:/} * http://www.example.org/services/local.html * https://www.example.org/checkout/confirm.php {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\"Examples of page descriptions:\" class=\"example\" %} {:/} * \"the Local Services page, the one with the lists of Residential Services and Business Services\" * \"the Confirm Purchase page after I entered my credit card information\" * \"the Search Results from the Services Directory Database\" {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ### What the Problem is {#prob} Provide details about what you were trying to do, and why it was difficult or impossible to do it. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\" Examples of problem descriptions:\" class=\"example\" %} {:/} * **keyboard navigation** - I can't get from the home page to the pages for paying my bill. I can't use a mouse so I use Tab to get to links, but I can't tab to the Pay Your Bills link. * **mouse clicking** - It's hard for me to get the mouse to stop on small things. In the survey, it’s hard to click the little circles. On other surveys I've used, I can click on the words as well as the circles, which is a lot easier. * **small text** - I can't read the bus timetables because the text is too small. I set the text size to Larger in my browser, but the text didn't get any bigger. * **overlapping text** - I had trouble reading the small text. I increased the text size in my browser, but then much of the text overlapped other text and the pictures. This made it impossible to read. * **color combinations** - It's hard to read some of the product descriptions because the colors make it hard to see the text. I have problems with blue/yellow and blue/orange color combinations. * **alt text** - I'm using a screen reader to listen to your website. Screen readers can’t read images; they read the alt text from the code. The images on this page are missing alt text. For example, I hear \"240.gif\" which my friend tells me is an image for Special Discounts. * **distracting animations** - I found the home page very confusing and it was difficult to find the information I wanted with all the animated things all over the page. They kept drawing my attention away from what I was trying to read. * **captions** - I was told there are good video tutorials on your website. But I cannot get much information from the videos because I can't hear them. They videos are missing captions. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ### What Computer and Software You are Using {#about} Provide details about your computer and software. If you don't know, maybe a friend, relative, or colleague can help you find that information. If not, you can skip this part. Include: * the **operating system** you are using, and the version (for example, Windows 10, macOS 10.13, or Linux Ubuntu 17.10) * the **browser** software you use to view the Web, and the version (for example, Edge, Internet Explorer (IE) 11, Firefox 60, Chrome 62.0, Opera 45, Safari 10.1.2, etc.) Also include the following information if it relates to the problem you are having: * any **settings** you have customized (for example, I set the Font Size to Largest in my browser) * any **assistive technology** that you use (for example, screen reader, screen magnification software, voice recognition software for input) {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\" Examples of detailed computer and software descriptions:\" class=\"example\" %} {:/} * I use Windows 10 with Internet Explorer 11 and Tazti voice recognition software * I use the NVDA screen reader version 2017.2 with Windows 10 Home edition and the Firefox browser version 60 {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} Even if you don’t know all the details, include what you do know. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title=\" Examples of simple descriptions:\" class=\"example\" %} {:/} * I use a Mac with the Safari browser and set the Universal Access to never use fonts smaller than 14. * I use Windows with Edge. I changed the Windows colors to give me yellow text on a black background as it’s easier to read. * I use the Opera browser with Windows and I use keystrokes to navigate websites. (I can't use a mouse at all.) {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} *Note:* **Do not reveal personal information such as passwords,** **via email or otherwise.** Do not provide any information that you are not comfortable disclosing. ## Include Sources for More Information {#pointers} Help the organization understand web accessibility issues. Consider including the following resources: * [Introduction to Web Accessibility]({{ \"/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/\" | relative_url }}) https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/ * [How People with Disabilities Use the Web]({{ \"/people-use-web/\" | relative_url }}) https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/ * [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}) https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/ ## Request Reply {#request} Ask the organization to reply to you. If you are comfortable giving your phone number, include your number in case they want to discuss the problem. ## Follow-Up as Needed {#follow-up} Responsible organizations will follow up with you. However, sometimes you might need to follow up with them. ### Be Available for Follow-up {#follow} The website developers might need more information from you to help them diagnose and fix the problem. ### Keep Records for Further Follow-Up {#records} You might need records if you later decide to [take further action](#action). In particular: * Keep copies of the website when you first encounter the problem. For example, take screenshots, save the pages on your hard drive, or print the pages. If the website changes, make new copies of it. * Keep printed or electronic copies of all correspondence, including email, postal mail, and online forms. * Keep records of all phone calls. Include the dates, the names of who you talked with, and notes on what was said. ### Getting a Response {#response} You might get a quick response, or it might take longer to hear back. It depends on the organization's culture, policies, and internal systems. Government agencies and other organizations providing public services may be required to respond. You might get an automatic reply that the organization received your feedback. The organization should follow up later with a direct reply to your issue. Sometimes the organization does not have expertise in accessibility. They may not understand your feedback. They might assume the issue is with your browser or assistive technology. The organization might fix the problem and not notify you. If you do not receive satisfactory responses within a reasonable timeframe, consider taking further action, described below. ### Further Action to Consider {#action} If you feel the organization is not adequately resolving the accessibility problem, consider taking further action. For example: * Contact an advocacy group to see if they will get involved. * Contact the organization's senior management, such as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Managing Director, or Chief Business Officer. * Use online community resources, such as blogging or social networking, to tell others about the inaccessible website. Share what the organization did in response to your contact. * Contact the press or write a \"letter to the editor\". * Starting a petition (maybe online). * If it is a government website, contact your local government. * Lodge a formal complaint with the relevant industry regulator or ombudsman. * Contact the government department responsible for disability rights, older people's rights, or human rights. * Consider legal action. For example, based on web accessibility requirements in [anti-discrimination regulations in your country]({{ \"/policies/\" | relative_url }}). ## Sample Emails {#samples} Feel free to adapt these sample emails for your situation. ### Email Template {#template} In the template below, the [hints] in brackets are sections for you to complete. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" title='Subject: Problem encountered on [XYZ website]' %} {:/} **Dear** [name or position of person you're writing to] **I had problems on the web page** [web address (URL), or describe the page where the problem occurs] **I tried to** [describe what you were trying to do on their site]. **The problem was** [describe what doesn't work for you or what doesn't work the way you expected]. **This meant I was unable to** [describe what you had hoped to do on their website].

I listen to web pages with the NVDA screen reader (version 2017.2). I use Windows 10 and Internet Explorer 11. My colleague told me that you had some heat wave information so I went to the news page, however there was something strange going on. I found a sentence about the heat wave and temperatures, but then there was something about the violin case man. Much of the page seemed mixed up and was confusing for me to listen to - it appears it was not written in a linear fashion so that someone like me using a screen reader can understand it. Also, your news page doesn't have any headings. Headings are important because I use them to get an overview of the page and to help me navigate to the stories. Please check out this web accessibility information from the W3C: * [Introduction to Web Accessibility]({{\"/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/\" | relative_url }}) https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/ * [How People with Disabilities Use the Web]({{ \"/people-use-web/\" | relative_url }}) https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/ * [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}) https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/ Please let me know when these problems are addressed.

I can't use a mouse very much because my arms don’t work well. Usually I tab around web pages. Anyway, on your survey page I was only able to get to the question about how many cars we have when I tabbed around. When I did try using the mouse to answer the 'where do I live' question, I couldn't click on the words like I can on many other sites' forms, I had to click the little circle before the words. In case it helps you diagnose and fix the problem: I have a Win10 laptop and use Chrome browser Version 60.0.3112.78. To learn more about these and other accessibility issues, check out www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility By the way, making your site accessible will benefit Citylights too, see Developing a Digital Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization (www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/Overview.html). Please tell me when you've fixed these problems. Happy to help you further. You can ring me at 12-345-6789.

The browser settings on this page should work when websites and browsers meet **[accessibility guidelines]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/\" | relative_url }})** and are designed for accessibility, flexibility, and user control. However: * **some websites are designed to defeat user's browser settings** * **some browsers do not provide as much user control** Text resizing, browser zoom, and other user choices may not work consistently on websites that do not meet accessibility guidelines. ### Should all websites include instructions like this? It's up to the website owner. It's not an accessibility requirement that websites include information on changing text sizes and colors like this page. We chose to include this information to help people who want to know how to change their browser settings. ### Should websites provide a widget to change text, color, etc. We chose provide these instructions so that users can learn how to change the display for all websites. Widgets change only the website they are on. ### Note: No Endorsement The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) does not endorse specific web browsers or extensions and does not recommend one over another. While some common browsers are included in this page, mention of a specific browser does not imply endorsement or recommendation.",

    "title": "Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion",
    "text": "## Introduction {:.no-display} *Accessibility, usability, and inclusion* are closely related aspects in creating a web that works for everyone. Their goals, approaches, and guidelines overlap significantly. It is most effective to address them together when designing and developing websites and applications. There are a few situations when it's important to focus specifically on one aspect. For example, when developing standards and policies. Researching the accessibility needs of people with disabilities helps with developing those. This article briefly: - explains the distinctions and overlaps between accessibility, usability, and inclusive design, - encourages increased coordination across research and practice in these disciplines, and, - points out the importance of maintaining the focus of accessibility on people with disabilities. Distinctions and Overlaps {#terms} ------------------------- **Accessibility**: addresses discriminatory aspects related to equivalent user experience for people with disabilities. Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can equally perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools. It also means that they can contribute equally without barriers. For more information, see the [Accessibility introduction]({{ \"/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/\" | relative_url }}). **Usability**: is about designing products to be effective, efficient, and satisfying. Usability includes *user experience design*. This may include general aspects that impact everyone and do not disproportionally impact people with disabilities. Usability practice and research often does not sufficiently address the needs of people with disabilities. **Inclusion**: is about diversity, and ensuring involvement of everyone to the greatest extent possible. In some regions this is also referred to as *universal design* and *design for all*. It addresses a broad range of issues including: * accessibility for people with disabilities; * access to and quality of hardware, software, and Internet connectivity; * computer literacy and skills; * economic situation; * education; * geographic location; * culture; * age, including older and younger people; * and language. ### Accessibility and Usability {#accessible-usable} Accessibility primarily focuses on people with disabilities. Many accessibility requirements improve usability for everyone, especially in limiting situations. For example, providing sufficient contrast benefits people using the web on a mobile device in bright sunlight or in a dark room. Captions benefit people in noisy and in quiet environments. Some people have age-related functional limitations, and may not identify these as \"disability\". Accessibility addresses these situations too. Accessibility includes: - **Requirements that are technical and relate to the underlying code rather than to the visual appearance**. For example, they ensure that websites work well with assistive technologies. This includes screen readers that read aloud content, and screen magnifiers that enlarge content. Voice recognition software used to input text is another form of assistive technology. These aspects are typically not a focus of usability research and practice. - **Requirements that relate to user interaction and visual design**. Inadequate design can cause significant barriers for people with disabilities. That is why they are included. For example, understandable instructions and feedback for website forms and applications is good usability. They also help people with cognitive and learning disabilities. Without such requirements, some people with disabilities may be excluded from using the Web. There is a significant overlap between accessibility and usability. [ISO 9241-11](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16883), defines usability as: > The \"extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals effectively, efficiently and with satisfaction in a specified context of use\". This could address accessibility ***when***: * \"specified users\" includes people with a range of disabilities, and * \"specified context of use\" includes accessibility considerations such as assistive technologies. But usability practice and research often does not consider the needs of people with disabilities. ### Accessibility and Inclusion {#inclusive-design} Several accessibility requirements also benefit people and situations that are a focus of inclusive design. For example, [Web Accessibility Benefits People With and *Without* Disabilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/soc#groups) describes accessibility benefits for: - people with low literacy or not fluent in the language, - people with low bandwidth connections or using older technologies, - new and infrequent users, and, - [mobile device users]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag-mobile-overlap/\" | relative_url }}). However, accessibility focuses on disability and does not try to address broader issues. Other efforts, such as [internationalization](https://www.w3.org/International/), address other inclusion issues. Keeping accessibility focused on disabilities encourages research and development on the specific needs of people with disabilities, and solutions that are optimized for these specific needs. Accessible Design ----------------- There are [guidelines, standards, and techniques for web accessibility]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/\" | relative_url }}), such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }})), which is the international standard [ISO/IEC 40500](https://www.w3.org/blog/2012/10/wcag-20-is-now-also-isoiec-405/). Yet when designers, developers, and project managers approach accessibility as a checklist to meet these standards, the focus is only on the technical aspects of accessibility. As a result, the human interaction aspect is often lost, and accessibility is not achieved. Combining accessibility standards and usability processes with real people ensures that web design is technically and functionally usable by people with disabilities. This is referred to as *usable accessibility* or *accessible user experience (UX)*. ### Usable Accessibility Web designers and developers can use usability processes, methods, and techniques, to address the user interface component of accessibility. While the considerations of people with disabilities are not always included in common practices, they can be easily integrated into user experience design. A key aspect is incorporating **real people** in design: - Ensuring that everyone involved in web projects understands the basics of [how people with disabilities use the Web]({{ \"/people-use-web/\" | relative_url }}), - [Involving users with disabilities]({{ \"/planning/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}) early and throughout the design process, and - [Involving users in evaluating web accessibility]({{ \"/test-evaluate/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}). **Accessibility standards** also have an important role in accessible design. For example, understanding the basic [Accessibility Principles]({{ \"/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/\" | relative_url }}) and using them for developing and evaluating early prototypes helps the development team provide basic accessibility in the earliest stages. Addressing accessibility at later stages becomes increasingly difficult. Also, usability processes and user involvement alone cannot address all accessibility issues. Even large projects cannot cover the diversity of disabilities, adaptive strategies, and assistive technologies. Accessibility guidelines, standards, and techniques ensure that the wide range of issues are adequately covered. Conclusion ---------- Accessibility practitioners and researchers can incorporate usability techniques to improve 'usable accessibility'. User experience designers and researchers can incorporate accessibility to make their designs work better for more people in more situations. Addressing accessibility, usability, and inclusion together can more effectively lead to a more accessible, usable, and inclusive web for everyone. Resources to help are linked throughout this page. For more on this topic, see [The role of accessibility in a universal web](http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/88013), which: - provides a more in-depth exploration of the importance and benefits of accessibility as a distinct discipline, and - encourages increased communication and coordination between accessibility, usability, and inclusion research and practice.",

These test rules address automated, semi-automated, and manual testing. ACT makes accessibility testing more transparent, and thus reduces confusion caused by different interpretations of accessibility guidelines. ## Who ACT is for The primary audience of Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) is developers of accessibility evaluation methodologies and testing tools. They write, share, and implement ACT Rules into their products and services. A secondary audience is accessibility experts. They often assist in setting an organization's accessibility policy, and it is important for them to know what ACT Rules do, and how they relate to their own requirements. Who ACT is **not** for: Users of accessibility tools (web developers, content authors, QA testers, etc.) are not expected to read ACT. These audiences will use products and services that implement ACT Rules. ## What is in ACT ### ACT Rules Format 1.0 **[Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/)** is a W3C Recommendation (web standard) that defines a format for writing test rules. The latest [Editor Draft](https://w3c.github.io/wcag-act/act-rules-format.html) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/wcag-act/) are available for future development. #### Technical document format The ACT Rules Format follows the W3C format for technical specifications, which includes several sections at the beginning: links to different versions, editors, copyright, abstract, and status with the link to errata and the email address for comments. ### ACT Rules Repository **[List of Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/act/rules/\" | relative_url }})** formally published by the W3C Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG). More rules are expected in the coming months. The [ACT Rules Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/act-r/) developed over [50 rules](https://act-rules.github.io/rules/), many of which will be submitted to the AG WG for review and approval. Other entities can also contribute candidate rules for review and approval. #### Future of ACT Rules We expect more ACT Rules to be formally published by W3C as further candidate rules are contributed by the community. Contact Shadi Abou-Zahra for questions on how to contribute candidate rules and participate in the review process of ACT Rules. ## Who develops ACT The [ACT Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/) of the W3C Accessibility Guidelines Working Group ([AG WG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/)) develops the [ACT Rules Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/) specification. The ACT Task Force also reviews test rules contributed by the community in first instance. Formal publication of the ACT Rules Format specification and of ACT Rules listed on this page is made by AG WG. The [ACT Rules Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/act-r/) develops test rules according to the ACT Rules Format specification. These rules by the community group do not have any formal standing in the W3C process. Opportunities for contributing to ACT and other WAI work are introduced in [Participating in WAI](/WAI/participation). ## Additional information For more information, see: * [Calibrate Your Accessibility Evaluation with ACT blog post](https://www.w3.org/blog/2019/10/calibrate-your-accessibility-evaluation-with-act/) * [Harmonized Accessibility Testing blog post](https://www.w3.org/blog/2019/07/harmonized-accessibility-testing/) * [ACT Rules Community Group GitHub workspace](https://act-rules.github.io/)",

It especially helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.** Without WAI-ARIA certain functionality used in Web sites is not available to some users with disabilities, especially people who rely on screen readers and people who cannot use a mouse. WAI-ARIA addresses these accessibility challenges, for example, by defining ways for functionality to be provided to assistive technology. With WAI-ARIA, developers can make advanced Web applications accessible and usable to people with disabilities. This page describes the problems that WAI-ARIA addresses, and introduces the WAI-ARIA suite of technical documents. Many of the terms used in this page—including *Web content*, *user agent*s, and *assistive technology*—are described in [Introduction to Web Accessibility]({{ \"/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/\" | relative_url}}) and [Essential Components of Web Accessibility]({{ \"/fundamentals/components/\" | relative_url }}). ### Technical Solutions WAI-ARIA provides a framework for adding attributes to identify features for user interaction, how they relate to each other, and their current state. WAI-ARIA describes navigation techniques to mark regions and common Web structures as menus, primary content, secondary content, banner information, and other types of Web structures. For example, with WAI-ARIA, developers can identify regions of pages and enable keyboard users to easily move among regions, rather than having to press Tab many times. WAI-ARIA also includes technologies to map controls, live regions, and events to accessibility application programming interfaces (APIs), including custom controls used for rich Internet applications. WAI-ARIA techniques apply to widgets such as buttons, drop-down lists, calendar functions, tree controls (for example, expandable menus), and others. WAI-ARIA provides Web authors with the following: - Roles to describe the type of widget presented, such as \"menu\", \"treeitem\", \"slider\", and \"progressbar\" - Roles to describe the structure of the Web page, such as headings, regions, and tables (grids) - Properties to describe the state widgets are in, such as \"checked\" for a check box, or \"haspopup\" for a menu. - Properties to define live regions of a page that are likely to get updates (such as stock quotes), as well as an interruption policy for those updates—for example, critical updates may be presented in an alert dialog box, and incidental updates occur within the page - A way to provide keyboard navigation for the Web objects and events, such as those mentioned above ## Versions {#versions} * [WAI-ARIA 1.0](/TR/wai-aria/) was published as a completed W3C Recommendation on 20 March 2014. * [WAI-ARIA 1.1](/TR/wai-aria-1.1/) was published as a completed W3C Recommendation on 14 December 2017. * [WAI-ARIA 1.2](/TR/wai-aria-1.2/) is under development. The latest status is updated in the [FAQ: What is the current status of WAI-ARIA development?](/WAI/aria/faq#update) ### WAI-ARIA 1.2 {#wai-aria-1_2} The 1.2 version will extend WAI-ARIA 1.1 to provide a small number of features to complete the HTML + ARIA accessibility model. For 1.2, user agent implementation guidance is provided as a suite of accessibility API mapping specifications that describe how to expose semantics of WAI-ARIA and other web content languages to accessibility APIs. Published WAI-ARIA 1.2 Working Drafts are as follows: - **[WAI-ARIA 1.2](/TR/wai-aria-1.2/) technical specification**, provides features to define accessible user interface elements and in order to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications. It is primarily for developers of Web browsers, assistive technologies, and other user agents; developers of Web technologies (technical specifications); and developers of accessibility evaluation tools. - **[Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.2](/TR/core-aam-1.2/)**, describes how user agents should expose semantics of web content languages to accessibility APIs. The core module defines support that applies across multiple content technologies, including general keyboard navigation support and mapping of general-purpose WAI-ARIA features; other specifications will extend this for specific technologies. - **[Accessible Name and Description: Computation and API Mappings 1.2](/TR/accname-1.2/)**, describes how user agents determine names and descriptions of accessible objects from web content languages and expose them in accessibility APIs. This allows assistive technologies to associate and relay the name or description of objects to users. - **[HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0](/TR/html-aam-1.0/)**, extends Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.2 and Accessible Name and Description: Computation and API Mappings 1.2 to define how user agents map HTML markup to platform accessibility application programming interfaces (APIs). Provides HTML-specific guidance for how the HTML user agent must respond to keyboard focus, native HTML features, and role, state and property attributes provided via WAI-ARIA. - **[SVG Accessibility API Mappings 1.0](/TR/svg-aam-1.0/)**, extends Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.2 to define how user agents map SVG markup to platform accessibility application programming interfaces (APIs). When supported by user agents, its features allow SVG authors to create accessible rich internet applications, including charts, graphs, and other drawings. Provides SVG-specific guidance for how the SVG user agent must respond to keyboard focus, native SVG features, and role, state and property attributes provided via WAI-ARIA. - **[WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.2](/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/)**, recommends approaches to help web application developers make widgets, navigation, and behaviors accessible using WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties. It describes considerations that might not be evident to most authors from the WAI-ARIA specification which is oriented primarily at user agent implementers. Additional documents are expected in this suite, including other accessibility API mappings and updated authoring guidance. Editors' drafts under development can be accessed in the [WAI-ARIA GitHub Repository](https://github.com/w3c/aria/). *W3C Recommendations* and *Working Group Notes* are briefly explained in [How WAI Develops Accessibility Guidelines through the W3C Process](/WAI/intro/w3c-process), which also describes milestones in the W3C Process. ### Technical document format The WAI-ARIA documents follow the W3C format for technical specifications which includes several sections at the beginning: links to different versions, editors, copyright, abstract, and status with the link to errata and the email address for comments. ## Who develops WAI-ARIA The WAI-ARIA technical documents are developed by the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group ([ARIA WG](/WAI/ARIA/)), which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](/)) Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](/WAI/)). For more information about the working group, see the [ARIA WG public page](/WAI/ARIA/). [How WAI Develops Accessibility Guidelines through the W3C Process: Milestones and Opportunities to Contribute](/WAI/intro/w3c-process) describes formal periods for public review. Opportunities for review and comment of WAI documents are announced on the [WAI home page](/WAI/) and [WAI Interest Group](/WAI/IG/) mailing list. An email address for sending comments is included in the \"Status of this Document\" section.

EARL uses the Resource Description Framework (RDF) to define the terms for expressing test results. ## Who EARL is for EARL is primarily intended for developers of: - Web accessibility evaluation tools - Web quality assurance and validation tools - Web authoring and development tools - Web content description and labeling frameworks ## What is in EARL EARL is an RDF vocabulary, the terms of which are defined by the following specifications: - [Evaluation And Report Language (EARL) 1.0 Schema](http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) - defines the core schema for EARL. - [Developer Guide for Evaluation And Report Language (EARL) 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Guide/) - describes the motivations for EARL and provide a tutorial introduction on how to use the terms. - [HTTP Vocabulary in RDF 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/HTTP-in-RDF10/) - provides terms to record HTTP exchanges between a client and a server in RDF. - [Representing Content in RDF 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/Content-in-RDF10/) - provides terms to represent content (such as HTTP body entities) in RDF. - [Pointer Methods in RDF 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/Pointers-in-RDF10/) - provides terms for representing pointers - entities that permit identifying a portion or segment of a piece of content. - [Requirements for the Evaluation and Report Language (EARL) 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Requirements/) - describes the requirements for the scope, design, and features of EARL. EARL 1.0 reuses other RDF terms such as those provided by the [Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI)](http://www.dublincore.org/) and the [Friend Of A Friend (FOAF)](http://www.foaf-project.org/) project. EARL terms can also be reused for other purposes, such as for content description and content labeling. ## What is the status of EARL EARL specifications are published as non-normative W3C Working Group Notes. ### Technical document format The EARL documents follow the W3C format for technical specifications, which includes several sections at the beginning: links to different versions, editors, copyright, abstract, and status with the link to errata and the email address for comments. Most WAI specifications have a link at the top to the Table of Contents. ## Who develops EARL EARL documents were developed by the [Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ERT WG)](/WAI/ER), which was part of the World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org)) Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](/WAI/)) until 2014. Some of the terms defined by EARL are being used by the [Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/) currently being developed by the [ACT Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/). See [ACT Overview]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/act/\" | relative_url }}) for more information.

Overview pages include: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) Overview http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) Overview http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/uaag Evaluation and Report Language (EARL) Overview http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/earl WAI-ARIA Overview for Accessible Rich Internet Applications http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria Referencing Guidelines and Other Technical Specifications WAI's technical specifications (WCAG, WAI-ARIA, and the others listed above) use a \"shortname\" in the URI (the Web address); for example, \"WCAG\" and \"ATAG\" are shortnames. Specific versions are indicated with a number in the URL. Without a number, you get the latest version. Latest completed version To link to the latest completed version, do not include a number. For example: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/ Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG/ User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG/ Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/ Note: Links: The content at these links will change when new versions are published. New versions will often change the internal links (called fragments, targets, or anchors, e.g., \"#focus-area\"). References: When policies do not include a version number, they can be interpreted to reference the latest version. Specific version We recommend that you reference the latest version without a number as explained above, unless there is a reason to reference a specific version. To link to a specific version, include the version number, for example: Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/ User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0 http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/ Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/ Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.1 https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/ Links to the technical specification and the Overview page Even when linking to the standard, it is usually good to include a link to the Overview page as well. For example: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, WCAG Overview Example: Linking to WCAG URI Use Document linked to: Will the content at this URI change? www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag For most links about WCAG WCAG Overview Yes, content will be updated with new versions, but the fragments/targets/anchors will mostly remain stable www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/ For links to the latest version of the WCAG standard The latest version of WCAG Yes, content will change when there are new versions, and fragments/targets/anchors may also change www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/ For links specifically to Version 2.0 of the WCAG technical specification, and not subsequent versions WCAG Version 2.0 No For more formal guidance on referring to WCAG, see Appendix A How to refer to WCAG 2.0 from other documents. Linking to Techniques, Understanding Documents, and Other \"Notes\" While the standards listed above will not change once they are completed, most of the the supporting material that is advisory will be updated. Supporting technical material is usually published as \"W3C Working Group Notes\". This includes: Techniques for WCAG http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-TECHS/ Understanding WCAG http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG/ WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1 https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/ The content at these URIs will change when they are updated. In most cases, you should not include numbers in these links, so that your links provide the latest information and best practices. Stable \"dated URIs\" In rare cases when you want to link to specific information in a Technique or other Note, and not the latest information, use the &quot;dated URI&quot; that is listed at the top of the main web page under \"This version:\". For example: The &lt;a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20081211/\"&gt;Techniques for WCAG 2.0 published 11 December 2008&lt;/a&gt; states that \"The WCAG WG encourages submission of such techniques so they can be considered for inclusion in this document...\". Referencing WAI-ARIA versus just ARIA \"WAI-ARIA\" is the formal abbreviation for the Accessible Rich Internet Applications documents. It is now acceptable to use just &quot;ARIA&quot; in informal references. Additional Information If you have additional questions, you can contact WAI directly at wai@w3.org.

User agents include browsers, browser extensions, media players, readers and other applications that render web content. Some accessibility needs are better met in the browser than in the web content, such as text customization, preferences, and user interface accessibility. A user agent that follows UAAG 2.0 will improve accessibility through its own user interface and its ability to communicate with other technologies, including assistive technologies (software that some people with disabilities use to meet their requirements). All users, not just users with disabilities, will benefit from user agents that follow UAAG 2.0. UAAG is part of a series of accessibility guidelines, including the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG WG) and the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG). [Essential Components of Web Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/components) explains the relationship between the different guidelines. ## Who UAAG is for UAAG is primarily for developers of Web browsers, browser extensions, media players, readers and other applications that render web content. UAAG and supporting resources are also intended to meet the needs of many different audiences, including policy makers, managers, and others. For example: - People who want to choose user agents that are more accessible can use UAAG to [evaluate user agents](http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/10/eval) - People who want to encourage their existing user agent developer to improve accessibility in future versions can file bugs against UAAG or can refer the user agent vendor to UAAG. ## UAAG 2.0 [UAAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/) was developed to help make future generations of Web browsers more accessible, to provide alternative information based on the users technology and platform, and to align with WCAG 2.0 and ATAG 2.0. UAAG 2.0 is complete. It provides specific guidance for browsers and other user agents, and reference information for accessibility professionals. The User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (UAWG) has identified implementations of the features (\"success criteria\") of UAAG 2.0, demonstrating that it is possible to implement the UAAG 2.0 success criteria. The threshold for a specification becoming a formal W3C Recommendation ordinarily involves extensive formal testing of implementations of each success criteria across multiple user agents -- which in the case of UAAG 2.0 would have required manual testing of many browser user interfaces. Sufficient testing resources were not available for this level of testing. W3C does not currently plan to advance UAAG 2.0 to Recommendation status. W3C plans to include user agent accessibility considerations in future accessibility guidelines work. UAAG 2.0 is still needed and relevant, and may be increasingly relevant in the future. The work of the current task forces for Mobile Accessibility and Low Vision Accessibility show the importance of combined consideration of content, user interface, extensions, applications and user agents. While many of the UAAG 2.0 features are supported in individual browsers, there is a need for more consistent and reliable support for accessibility features across all browsers and user agents. UAAG 2.0 provides specific accessibility guidance for user agent developers who want to build a better user experience for all. **We recommend that you use UAAG 2.0.** ## UAAG 2.0 Supporting Documents [UAAG 2.0 Reference: Explanations, Examples, and Resources for User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20-Reference/) provides supporting information for those using UAAG 2.0. Each UAAG 2.0 success criterion is explained with the intent of the success criterion, examples, additional resources, where it is typically implemented and what aspect of the user agent it applies to. The [Mobile Accessibility Examples](https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-UAAG20-Reference-20151215/mobile.html) are a subset of the UAAG 2.0 Reference. These examples (or use cases) highlight how UAAG can help people with disabilities who are using mobile devices. ## UAAG 1.0 [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/) was approved in December 2002 ## Who develops UAAG UAAG technical documents are developed by the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group ([UAWG](http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/)), which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org)) Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/)). For more information about the working group, see the [UAWG page](http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/). The UAWG is closed as of January 2016.

    "title": "Why Standards Harmonization is Essential to Web Accessibility",
    "text": "{::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"start\" h=\"2\" title=\"Abstract\" class=\"full\" %} {:/} This document explains the key role that harmonization of standards plays in increasing the accessibility of the Web for people with disabilities. It examines how adoption of a consistent set of international technical standards, the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) guidelines for Web content, authoring tools, browsers and media players can drive more rapid progress on Web accessibility, and make the design and development of accessible Web sites more efficient. Common standards for Web content accessibility and for authoring tools encourages the development of tools that support production of accessible Web content. Likewise, the adoption of a consistent standard for browser and media player accessibility would improve access to and reinforce the accessibility of Web content, and would help ensure that accessible content will be more available through assistive technologies used by some people with disabilities. This document introduces the concept of harmonization and causes of fragmentation in the area of Web accessibility standards, and examines the impact of harmonization and fragmentation on Web developers, tool developers, and organizations. It also suggests action steps for promoting Web accessibility standards harmonization. {::nomarkdown} {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} {::options toc_levels=\"2\" /} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"start\" title=\"Page Contents\" %} {:/} - TOC is created automatically. {:toc} {::nomarkdown} {% include_cached toc.html type=\"end\" %} {:/} ## Overview In this document **\"standards harmonization\"** refers to **the adoption of a consistent set of** **international** **technical standards for accessibility of:** - Web content - browsers and media players - authoring tools Around the world there is currently **fragmentation** – **conflicting**, divergent technical standards** – rather than harmonization of Web accessibility standards. While W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is the most broadly adopted Web accessibility standard internationally, many countries have developed or are in the process of developing their own versions of technical guidelines or standards. Furthermore, there is sometimes one version of a guideline or standard at the national level, different versions at the provincial or state level, and yet different versions adopted by commercial, educational, and non-governmental organizations within the same country. For organizations with audiences spanning different regions or economic sectors, simply keeping track of the different requirements can be a challenge. Harmonization of Web accessibility standards is key to making an accessible Web, because it creates a unified market for authoring tools that produce conformant content. This unified market in turn drives more rapid development of improved authoring tools. Improved authoring tools make it easier to create accessible Web sites, and to repair previously inaccessible sites; for instance, by prompting for accessibility information such as alternative text for graphics, captions for audio, or summaries for data tables. Widespread availability of improved authoring tools can enable accessible design to become the prevailing design mode even for Web developers only minimally aware of the rationale for Web accessibility, or disinclined to learn guidelines and techniques for accessibility. Standards harmonization also creates a more compelling market for developers of tools used to evaluate Web content accessibility. It enables re-use of training and technical assistance resources for Web accessibility across different regions and economic sectors. Standards harmonization enables better access to information through browsers and media players, and better interoperability with specialized technologies that some people with disabilities must rely on. It enables development of information repositories containing accessible, compatible, and re-usable content. The [World Wide Web Consortium](http://www.w3.org/) (W3C) [Web Accessibility Initiative](http://www.w3.org/WAI/) (WAI) has developed: - [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}), which describe how to make Web content and Web sites accessible; - [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/atag/\" | relative_url }}), which describe how to make Web authoring tools that produce content conforming to WCAG and that are accessible for people with disabilities; - [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/uaag/\" | relative_url }}), which describe how to make browsers and media players accessible, and how to ensure their interoperability with assistive technologies. Together these three WAI guidelines provide mutually reinforcing solutions which result in more comprehensive and effective accessibility. W3C/WAI continues to advance these three guidelines by updating and refining them as Web technologies evolve, and is currently developing updated versions of the guidelines. ## Current Situation Fragmentation of Web accessibility guidelines can impact progress on Web accessibility in various ways: - **Changing the wording of individual provisions** in accessibility guidelines often changes the technical meaning of the provisions. This in turn changes what is required to meet a given level of conformance in those guidelines. This can make it more difficult for developers of authoring tools and evaluation tools (which are used to evaluate the accessibility of Web content), as they will then need to support potentially conflicting sets of implementation and evaluation techniques. - **Combining two or more different accessibility provisions** may likewise affect the meaning of these provisions. Again, this can change what is required to meet a given level of conformance to accessibility guidelines. As above, this can increase the burden for developers of authoring tools and evaluation tools, which play a key role in facilitating the production and evaluation of accessible Web content. - **Omitting or adding accessibility provisions** likewise changes what is required to meet a given level of conformance. This may similarly make it more difficult for developers of authoring tools and evaluation tools to support the resulting reduced or expanded conformance levels. Various circumstances or beliefs in different countries and organizations can contribute to the fragmentation of Web accessibility standards. For each such factor, or \"fragmentation driver,\" however, there is also a good reason to promote harmonization of standards: Fragmentation Driver Reason for Harmonization A restriction on the types of standards that governments can adopt; with a belief that W3C is not an official standards body W3C is the leading standards body for the Web industry. Many governments have adopted HTML or XML, and therefore already have mechanisms whereby they can adopt W3C standards. A requirement that only standards officially available in local language(s) can be adopted W3C now allows the development of authorized translations in local languages through its Policy for Authorized W3C Translations. For example, Authorized Translations of WCAG are available in several languages. The belief that only local guidelines can meet the needs of the local disability community Disability needs with regard to Web accessibility do not vary significantly from country to country. The belief that the needs of people with disabilities outside a country are different or not relevant The Web is worldwide. People with disabilities from other countries, with the same needs for accessibility and using the same kinds of assistive technologies, may need access to the Web-based resources of a particular country. The belief that W3C/WAI guidelines were developed by a single country W3C/WAI guidelines were developed with broad international input, and reflect needs from around the world. The belief that development of local guidelines is the best activity in which to invest local funding for Web accessibility Development of local guidelines takes scarce resources away from activities where building local capacity is crucial – such as development of education, awareness, training and technical assistance on Web accessibility. The belief that it is more practical in the long term to have locally developed guidelines Because Web technologies are constantly evolving, ongoing development and maintenance of local guidelines and techniques into the future may be prohibitively resource-intensive. The belief that Web accessibility can be more easily achieved through locally developed guidelines Web accessibility can be more easily achieved through increased availability of supporting tools and resources, including authoring tools, evaluation tools, browsers, media players, and training and technical resources. These tools and resources develop more rapidly when there is a unified market around a consistent international set of Web accessibility standards. ## Consequences ### Web Development {#webdev} For Web developers using today's authoring tools, development of accessible Web sites first requires an awareness of the need for Web accessibility, then a deliberate effort to apply WCAG. It may require working around features of authoring tools that make it hard to build accessible Web sites. For instance, some authoring tools still produce non-standard markup, which can be a barrier for accessibility. Authoring tools that conform to ATAG provide built-in support for production of accessible Web sites. When Web developers develop accessible Web sites using today's authoring tools, they may need to work around inconsistent support of Web standards in browsers and media players. For instance, inconsistent initial support in browsers for Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) features, such as CSS positioning, led many Web developers to rely on less accessible design solutions for layout for many years. Browsers and media players that conformed to UAAG would provide reliable support for accessibility features, making the jobs of Web developers much easier. Web developers must already learn a variety of Web technologies and tools in order to be competitive in their field. Harmonization of Web accessibility standards enables Web developers to learn one consistent set of guidelines and implementation techniques, rather than needing to learn many different guidelines; and it allows them to re-use training and technical assistance resources among a broader Web community. ### Authoring Tools {#auth} Increased availability of authoring tools conforming to the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) is key to making the Web accessible because, with such tools, Web content developers could more easily and more automatically create accessible Web sites. Authoring tool developers face competing priorities when deciding which features to build into their software. Product managers' decisions with regard to which features are included in product releases are frequently based on the extent of demand for a given set of features throughout their customer base. Harmonized standards mean a more unified customer demand. This strengthens the business case for accessibility for authoring tool developers and can tip the balance towards implementation of more accessibility features in their products. This, in turn, means more rapid availability of authoring tools with features supporting production of accessible content. ### Evaluation Tools {#evaldev} Developers of evaluation tools are also impacted by fragmented standards, as these can delay, and/or increase the development cost, of the evaluation tools. Time needed to implement evaluation tests for conflicting versions of guidelines could otherwise be used to improve evaluation tools by increasing their usability or accuracy. Harmonized Web accessibility standards would allow developers of accessibility evaluation tools to concentrate their efforts on implementing one set of evaluation tests, rather than multiple tests for overlapping or conflicting guidelines and standards in different regions or economic sectors. Improved evaluation tools enable more people to test Web sites more reliably, and help ensure more accessible Web sites. ### Organizations {#orgdev} When there is fragmentation of standards, organizations that have audiences spanning different geographic regions, countries, or economic sectors must keep track of multiple sets of requirements. Such organizations may need to provide additional authoring tools, evaluation tools, training resources and technical assistance for their Web developers. This can divert resources from the actual development work needed to ensure accessible Web sites. The increase in cost and effort resulting from fragmented standards may consequently make it more difficult to make a convincing business case for accessibility within the organization. Harmonized Web accessibility standards, on the other hand, allow organizations to re-use authoring and evaluation tools, training, and technical assistance resources throughout the organization, thereby achieving more cost-effective accessibility solutions. ### Browsers, Media Players, and Assistive Technologies {#browsers} The harmonization of Web accessibility standards is also a concern with regard to browsers and media players. Conflicting standards for browser accessibility can slow implementation of accessibility support. Browsers and media players' lack of conformance to the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) makes it harder for people with disabilities to access content on Web sites, and even to find and use the accessibility features that are already incorporated in some browsers and media players. Some of today's browsers and media players do not provide access to certain kinds of accessibility information that a Web content developer may have included in a Web site; for instance, long descriptions of complex visuals such as maps and graphs, or summaries of information in data tables. UAAG describes how browsers and media players can enable access to such information. UAAG also describes requirements for browsers and media players that can work smoothly with assistive technologies, which some people with disabilities use, such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, and voice recognition software. Implementation of accessibility standards in browsers and authoring tools is mutually reinforcing. Once browser developers implement Web accessibility features, authoring tool developers have more reason to provide authoring support for those features. For instance, once browsers provide access to summaries of data tables, authoring tool developers then have a stronger rationale to provide a means for content developers to add summaries to tables. Similarly, browser developers are influenced by what authoring tools support, and are more likely to implement accessibility features once they know that authoring tools will provide the relevant authoring support. ### Information Repositories {#repos} Online information repositories allow the gathering and storing of content for re-use in a variety of ways, including the creation of online learning modules. If the content in an information repository conforms to a consistent accessibility standard, then that content can be more easily shared among an unlimited number of users. It can be re-purposed and personalized according to user profiles, which may include information on preferred learning styles and the accessibility requirements of users with disabilities. With harmonized standards for accessibility of content in information repositories, educators and learners are able to freely transform shared resources according to user needs. ## Action Steps W3C continues to update and refine the WAI guidelines, supporting techniques, and other resources to keep pace with evolving Web technologies. The following steps can increase the international harmonization of Web accessibility standards, and help lead more rapidly to an accessible Web: - Participate in development of updated WAI guidelines and support material by reviewing and commenting on drafts, providing feedback during implementation trials, and/or participating in WAI Working Groups. *(See [Participating in WAI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/participation))* - Promote awareness among policy-makers, standards developers, technology developers, and disability communities of the strategic importance of standards harmonization towards achieving an accessible Web. - Ensure that developers of authoring tools, browsers, and media players are aware of the need for ATAG- and UAAG- conformant tools, and aware of how implementation of ATAG and UAAG can improve interoperability with assistive technologies and accelerate overall progress on Web accessibility. - For organizations which currently have guidelines that diverge from international standards, consider establishing mechanisms for rapid review and potential transition to the latest version of WCAG. - Assist in preparing authorized translations of WAI guidelines according to W3C's policy for authorized translations. - Redirect energies from the development of divergent standards to promoting awareness and providing implementation support for Web accessibility. ## Related Resources For information on W3C/WAI guidelines and techniques, including versions under development, see [WAI Guidelines and Techniques](http://www.w3.org/WAI/guid-tech.html).

Similarly, making websites accessible for people with disabilities is an integral part of high quality websites, and in some cases a legal requirement. Most Mobile Web specialists don't know about design issues for people with disabilities. Likewise, most web accessibility specialists don't know Mobile Web design best practices. **Websites (including applications) can more efficiently meet both goals when designers and developers understand the significant overlap between making a website accessible for a mobile device and for people with disabilities.** The similarities are introduced below along with benefits of addressing both and [resources with technical details of the overlap](#doc_resources). ## Similar Barriers Users of mobile devices and people with disabilities experience similar barriers when interacting with web content. For example, mobile phone users will have a hard time if a website's navigation requires the use of a mouse because they typically only have an alphanumeric keypad. Similarly, desktop computer users with a motor disability will have a hard time using a website if they can't use a mouse. Additionally, people with disabilities sometimes use mobile devices to access websites. ## Similar Solutions The W3C provides guidelines/standards on making accessible content and best practices for making mobile-friendly content. - [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" | relative_url }}) is a guide for making websites accessible to people with disabilities. - [Mobile Web Best Practices](http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/) (MWBP) is a guide for making websites usable from a mobile device. - [Mobile Web Application Best Practices](http://www.w3.org/TR/mwabp/) (MWABP) is a guide for developing and delivering web applications on mobile devices. There is an overlap between MWBP, MWABP and WCAG. For example, the MWBP best practice on [tab order](http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/#TAB_ORDER) (\"Create a logical order through links, form controls and objects\") corresponds with the WCAG 2.0 success criteria on [focus order](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#navigation-mechanisms-focus-order) (\"...focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability\"). ## Doing Both - Designing for Mobile and for Accessibility Following these two guidelines makes your web content more accessible to everyone regardless of situation, environment, or device. Designing to the guidelines together, instead of separately, can make the process more efficient — especially when considered [early in the project]({{ \"/planning/involving-users/\" | relative_url }}). Websites that already meet WCAG or MWBP are already well on the way to meeting the other. Understanding the overlap also strengthens the business case for adopting WCAG or MWBP in a website that already complies with one, or for adopting both together. See also [Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization](http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/Overview). ## Resources The following resources provide a detailed mapping of the overlap between the barriers and solutions for making websites accessible to people with disabilities and usable on mobile devices. - [**Shared Web Experiences: Barriers Common to Mobile Device Users and People with Disabilities**](http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/experiences) lists web interaction that is similar by a user with a disability and by a user with a mobile device. It links to recommendations for designing web content without these barriers from WCAG, MWBP, and MWABP. - [**Relationship between Mobile Web Best Practices (MWBP) and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**](http://www.w3.org/TR/mwbp-wcag/) includes the following pages: - [**From MWBP to WCAG 2.0**](http://www.w3.org/TR/mwbp-wcag/mwbp-wcag20.html) and [From MWBP to WCAG 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/mwbp-wcag/mwbp-wcag10.html) are designed for those who already know MWBP and want to learn how they relate to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). - [**From WCAG 2.0 to MWBP**](http://www.w3.org/TR/mwbp-wcag/wcag20-mwbp.html) and [From WCAG 1.0 to MWBP](http://www.w3.org/TR/mwbp-wcag/wcag10-mwbp.html) are designed for those who already know WCAG and want to learn how it relates to the Mobile Web Best Practices (MWBP).",

It is intended to develop into a W3C Standard in a few years. The current standard, WCAG 2, is introduced in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). The WCAG 3 documents explain how to make the web more accessible to people with disabilities. WCAG 3 applies to web content, apps, tools, publishing, and emerging technologies on the web. _(The rest of this page uses “website” for simplicity, yet WCAG applies more broadly than websites.)_ This page will be updated regularly as work on the WCAG 3 Draft progresses. ## Status: Draft for Review [W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/) is currently an **incomplete, unpolished Draft**. It includes: * proposed structure * draft [conformance model](#model) * 5 [draft example guidelines](#eg-guidelines) We are seeking input from evaluators, developers, designers, project managers, policy makers, people with disabilities, and others &mdash; particularly on: * Is this structure clear and useful? * How well does this draft conformance model work across different situations? * Other specific questions throughout the draft. We also welcome comments on the goals and parameters in [Requirements for WCAG 3.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0-requirements/). Additionally, we welcome comments on ways that the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group can better support your review, feedback, or inclusion in the process of creating WCAG 3. It will take you some time to understand the proposed new structure and conformance model in this WCAG 3 draft. * If you are interested in helping shape WCAG 3, we encourage you spend time reviewing this draft and submit comments. Before you review and comment on the Working Draft, please read through this page, including the [background](#background) and [review and commenting](#comments) sections near the end. * If you want to wait until WCAG 3 is more polished and stable to start learning it, you can read later drafts in 2021 or 2022. Later drafts of WCAG 3 will have most of the accessibility requirements (“success criteria”) from WCAG 2 and will have additional accessibility requirements, including some from [ATAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/) and [UAAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/). ## WCAG 3 Draft Approach _Reminder that WCAG 3 applies to web content, apps, tools, publishing, and emerging technologies on the web. Most of this page uses “website” for simplicity._ ### Some Similar, Some Different {#compare} **Goals** for WCAG 3 include: * be easier to understand * cover more user needs, including more needs of people with cognitive disabilities * be flexible to address different types of web content, apps, tools, and organizations (More goals are later on this page, in the [Background section](#background).) WCAG 3 is **similar** to previous versions in some ways. It has similar: * goal of providing guidance on making web content and apps accessible to people with disabilities * fundamental and specific accessibility requirements WCAG 3 is very **different** from previous versions in some ways. It has: * different structure * different conformance model * broader scope, beyond just web content ### Structure {% include box.html type=\"start\" class=\"simple aside\" %} Draft example: Guideline: Structured content Outcome: Headings organize content Outcome: Uses visually distinct headings Outcome: Conveys hierarchy with semantic structure Outcome: … {% include box.html type=\"end\" %} This WCAG 3 draft has: * **Guidelines** * Solutions to accessibility problems * More **granular** than the guidelines in WCAG 2 * Each guideline has outcomes * **Outcomes** * Testable statements * Similar to **success criteria** in WCAG 2, more granular * Outcomes include: * Critical errors * Rating scale More _granular_ means they are more specific, instead of broad. That generally makes them simpler. And it means there will be more of them. WCAG 3 supporting material includes: * **Methods** * Technology-specific ways to achieve an outcome * Tests for the outcome * Similar to **Techniques** for WCAG 2 * **How-To documents** * Explain more about each guideline, such as how it addresses accessibility needs * Similar to the **Understanding** documents for WCAG 2 * **Functional categories** of **functional needs** * Categorized list of needs of people with disabilities ### Draft Conformance Model {#model} The _conformance model_ is the way to determine and communicate how well a website (or app, tool, etc.) meets WCAG. The conformance model in this draft of WCAG 3 is very different from WCAG 2. It is intended to: * be more flexible for organizations (that is, owners and developers of websites, apps, tools, etc.) * encourage more accessible user experiences The conformance model in the WCAG 3 First Public Working Draft is a starting point for feedback. There are several different aspects of this draft WCAG 3 conformance model: * Conformance is more focused on **[processes](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#processes)** (tasks such as ordering an item or registering for a class), rather than web pages. * Outcomes can be **rated**, beyond just pass or fail. Rating scale is 0-4. * The ratings are averaged for a total score. There is also a **score for each functional category** (e.g., vision, hearing, memory, etc.). The levels are different, too: * Conformance levels are Bronze, Silver, Gold. * In WCAG 2, they are Level A, Level AA, Level AAA. * Bronze is similar to WCAG 2 Level AA, although not fully equivalent. * Bronze conformance requires: * No critical errors * Total score of 3.5 or higher * Score of 3.5 or higher in each functional category * Silver and Gold levels require “holistic tests” such as assistive technology testing and usability testing with participants with disabilities. Draft example: Ratings for the outcome \"Text alternative available\": Rating Criteria 0 Less than 60% of all images have appropriate text alternatives or there is a critical error in the process 1 60% - 69% of all images have appropriate text alternatives and no critical errors in the process 2 70%-79% of all images have appropriate text alternatives and no critical errors in the process 3 80%-94% of all images have appropriate text alternatives and no critical errors in the process 4 95% to 100% of all images have appropriate text alternatives and no critical errors in the process The conformance model in the First Public Working Draft will likely change in future iterations and drafts. It may change a little or may change substantively. ## Development ### Timeline The First Public Working Draft of WCAG 3.0 was published on 21 January 2021. It is the first of many drafts. The Working Group will focus on refining the structure and conformance model, and will provide updated drafts for review. Once that is more stable, the Group will focus on developing the accessibility requirements (guidelines, outcomes, and support material). After WCAG 3 is more stable, we will provide material to help those wanting to transition to WCAG 3; for example, mapping between WCAG 2 and 3 requirements. WCAG 3 is not expected to be a completed W3C standard for a few more years. WCAG 3 will not supersede WCAG 2, and WCAG 2 will not be deprecated, for at least several years after WCAG 3 is finalized. We will update this section with more specific timeline information as it is available. ### WCAG 3 Name (formerly \"Silver\" project) The name of WCAG 3 is different from WCAG 2: * WCAG **3** is W3C Accessibility Guidelines * WCAG **2** is Web Content Accessibility Guidelines “W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0” was chosen: * because of wide-spread familiarity with the “WCAG” acronym * to encompass the broader scope beyond “content” ### Who Develops WCAG 3 The WCAG technical documents are developed by the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group ([AG WG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/)) with the AG WG Silver Task Force and the Silver Community Group. These Groups are part of the World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org)) Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)). You can learn about the development process from [How WAI Develops Accessibility Standards through the W3C Process: Milestones and Opportunities to Contribute]({{ \"/standards-guidelines/w3c-process/\" | relative_url }}). We welcome your [comments on the WCAG 3 Working Drafts](#comments). Opportunities for contributing more directly to WCAG and other WAI work are introduced in [Participating in WAI]({{ \"/about/participating/\" | relative_url }}). {% include_cached excol.html type=\"start\" id=\"background\" %} ### Background: How we got from Silver to the WCAG 3 First Public Working Draft {#background} This expandable section provides more about the goals, user research, development process, and draft example guidelines. It introduces the motivations for the changes from WCAG 2 to WCAG 3. **Before you review and comment on the Draft, please read this section for context.** {% include_cached excol.html type=\"middle\" %} #### Research with People Who Use WCAG In 2016, project “Silver” was launched to explore a new approach to accessibility guidelines, through the AG WG Silver Task Force and the Silver Community Group. The groups conducted 18 months of research to identify stakeholders and understand their needs for accessibility guidance. The results where that generally WCAG users felt the guidance in WCAG 2 is important and useful, yet many thought that WCAG 2: * is difficult to understand * is too restrictive to include some requirements that address the needs of some people with disabilities, particularly cognitive disabilities * conformance model doesn’t meet their organization’s specific needs Silver held a Design Sprint in 2018 with 27 industry leaders across a variety of accessibility stakeholders. The two-day workshop took the problem statements identified by the research, and challenged participants to come up with innovative solutions. Silver made many prototypes of possible solutions and iterated through options with input from AG WG participants. The results form the basis of the WCAG 3.0 Working Draft. #### Goals {#goalsmore} From the WCAG-user research, Silver defined goals for next generation of accessibility guidelines from W3C WAI. They include: * Able to address more needs of people with disabilities * Account for the different impacts of specific accessibility issues on the real-world user experiences of people with disabilities * Easier to understand and easier to use, especially by people who are not technical * Flexible conformance model to work well for very different types of web content, apps, tools, &mdash; as well as organizations and people with disabilities * Enable minor bugs and oversight by content authors that do not significantly impact the accessible user experience to not invalidate conformance to WCAG * Encourage organizations to continue to improve accessibility (rather than stopping with WCAG 2 Level AA) More about goals is in [Requirements for WCAG 3.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0-requirements/). We welcome comments on this document, too. #### Development Process In defining the accessibility requirements in WCAG 3.0, Silver started fresh with a list of accessibility needs of people with disabilities. Development goes through this process: 1. From a specific user need, write an outcome to meet that user need. 2. Define tests to determine if the outcome is met. 3. Write the method to meet the outcome. 4. Group the outcomes under guidelines. 5. Write the How-To support information. #### _**Draft Examples**_ {#eg-guidelines} The draft guidelines included in the First Public Working Draft were selected to illustrate specific aspects of the proposed structure of WCAG 3 and relationship with WCAG 2. * [Text alternatives](https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/#text-alternatives) &mdash; Migrating a WCAG 2 success criterion as is into a WCAG 3 outcome * [Clear words](https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/#clear-words) &mdash; Adding a new accessibility requirement that was considered insufficiently testable for WCAG 2, and can be tested using the WCAG 3 rating scale * [Captions](https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/#captions) &mdash; Adapting WCAG 2 success criteria to emerging technologies, such as virtual reality, and demonstrating how scoring varies by context * [Structured content](https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/#structured-content) &mdash; Combining guidance from multiple WCAG 2 success criteria into a new WCAG 3 guideline with multiple outcomes * [Visual contrast of text](https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/#visual-contrast-of-text) &mdash; Combining guidance from multiple WCAG 2 success criteria, and a new algorithm with support for different situations These guidelines and outcomes are rough draft examples that will be refined and edited in future Working Drafts. {% include_cached excol.html type=\"end\" %} ### Review Questions and Your Comments {#comments} Comments on the first draft were requested by 26 February 2021.

If you can, invite people with disabilities to demonstrate assistive technologies and adaptive strategies they use. Include time for students to ask questions. If you cannot bring real people, refer to [Web Accessibility Perspectives Videos]({{ \"/perspective-videos/\" | relative_url }}) and [How People with Disabilities Use the Web]({{ \"/people-use-web/\" | relative_url }}). Mention examples like structured versus unstructured text and complex versus simple language, as potential barriers for everybody. #### Learning Outcomes for Topic Students should be able to: * Describe how some people with disabilities use the Web. * List some design features that benefit people with disabilities. * List some design barriers that exclude people with disabilities. * Recognize the impact of accessible versus inaccessible design. #### Teaching Ideas for Topic Optional ideas to teach the learning outcomes: * Point out how design features can enhance people's quality of life by teaching the social model of disability. Refer to Introduction to Web Accessibility page, [Accessibility in Context section]({{ \"/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/\" | relative_url }}#context). * Invite expert users with disabilities to show the assistive technologies and adaptive strategies they use when interacting with online banking, online shopping or eGovernment. Ask these users to explain how technology and the Web benefits them. * Coach students in trying out assistive technologies and adaptive strategies by themselves. For example, invite them to follow advanced users and experiment with text to speech, speech recognition, and other accessibility features built into their mobile phones. Ask students to reflect on their experiences. * Explain how different accessibility features and barriers affect use of the content with assistive technologies and adaptive strategies. For an introduction to certain assistive tools and adaptive strategies, refer to [Tools and Techniques]({{ \"/people-use-web/tools-techniques/\" | relative_url }}). **Important:** * Emphasize the diversity among people with disabilities, even when those users have the same type of disability. * For information on avoiding clichés and myths, see [Interacting with People with Disabilities {% include_cached external.html %}](http://www.uiaccess.com/accessucd/interact.html). #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Practice &mdash; Students explore the use of assistive technologies to perform a task, such as reading the news, making a purchase, or interacting in social networks. Assess students' capacity to understand how the assistive technology functions and interact with it. * Presentation &mdash; Students present digital life and most important use cases for a particular type of disability they are interested in. Assess students' capacity to reflect on the benefits of computers and the Web for people with disabilities. * Portfolio &mdash; Students research about how technology helped popular people with disabilities in their daily lives. Examples: Frida Kahlo, Stephen Hawking, or Stevie Wonder. Assess students' capacity to identify how people with disabilities use technology. {% include excol.html type=\"end\" %} {% include excol.html type=\"start\" %} ### Topic: Scope of Web Accessibility {% include excol.html type=\"middle\" %} Introduce the definition and scope of web accessibility. Present common terminology in [Introduction to Web Accessibility]({{ \"/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/\" | relative_url }}). Explain the overlaps between accessibility and usability.

Focus on the widespread use of web content and applications across different types of devices (desktop, mobile, television, etc.). Emphasize that accessibility favors social participation (for education, employment, commerce, healthcare, entertainment, etc.). Encourage students to participate in the discussion by adding any previous experiences of access barriers and exposure to accessibility. * Engage students in a conversation about the relationship between accessibility for people with disabilities and other people: older people, people not fluent in a language, people new to technology or with lower digital skills, and others. * Explain that accessibility is part of overall inclusion, since accessibility features benefit all users as well as those with disabilities. * Define usability as the discipline of designing products to be effective, efficient, and satisfying. Describe some overlaps in usability and accessibility. Explain that accessibility is needed to cover those aspects from the perspective of people with disabilities. * Introduce examples of accessibility in urban environments, buildings, transportation, etc. Explain how these relate to the digital context. Use ramps and high-contrast features to illustrate how accessibility characteristics are also beneficial for all users. * Refer to accessibility as a social right for people with disabilities under the United Nations [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html). #### Ideas to Assess Knowledge for Topic Optional ideas to support assessment: * Debate &mdash; From a given set of accessibility features in buildings, transportation, education, or healthcare, students draw analogies to web accessibility and share with their peers. Assess students' capacity to recognize how some features help make digital products accessible. * Presentation &mdash; Students select a device (e.g., computer, smartphone, smartwatch, television, etc.) and describe the accessibility features and settings that are available on that device. Assess students' capacity to identify accessibility features in a given product. * Presentation &mdash; Students describe a feature or setting and elaborate on how it benefits many people.

Video on Video Captions Enable Audio Description This video information is available as a Text Transcript with Description of Visuals below. What is “Video Captions”? Captions are a text form of audio information in video and animations. This includes the words that are spoken, who is speaking when it is not evident, and important sounds like music, laughter, and noises. Captions must be synchronized with the visual content to contextualize them. Who depends on this feature? People who are deaf and cannot hear the audio. People who are hard of hearing and cannot hear some of the content. People with cognitive and learning disabilities who need to see and hear the content to better understand it. What are the additional benefits? Content can be used in loud environments where you cannot hear the audio. Content can be used in silent environments where you cannot turn on sound. Content can be better understood by people hearing and seeing the information, for example, people who are less fluent in the language spoken. Content can be read rather than watched, which is easier and quicker for some people. Content in text form, such as caption files and transcripts, can be better indexed by search engines. Content can be used without needing to download video files, for example, to save data on mobile. What needs to happen for this to work? Captions must be made available with pre-recorded and live video content. Voice recognition software can help create captions for some type of videos. Sometimes such voice recognition software is built into the computer or social media platform. Automatically-generated captions often need editing. For many languages there are captioning services, often also remote services.

Video on Colors with Good Contrast Enable Audio Description This video information is available as a Text Transcript with Description of Visuals below. What is “Colors with Good Contrast”? Colors must have sufficient contrast between text color and its background (technically called luminosity contrast ratio). This includes text on images, icons, and buttons. Also colors used to convey information on diagrams, maps, and other types of images must be distinguishable. Who depends on this feature? People with low contrast sensitivity, which is common in older people. People with color blindness who cannot distinguish between certain colors. What are the additional benefits? Content works in different lighting conditions, such as sunlight and glare. Content is easier to read by everyone, including those who do not have specific visual conditions. What needs to happen for this to work? Select text and background colors that provide sufficient contrast. There are tools to help check and select appropriate color combinations. This is ideally done during the early design stage and the selection of color palettes. While some people need high contrast, some people are sensitive to brightness and need to change the colors. Learn more Accessibility Principle: Content is easier to see and hear Getting Started: Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background Easy Check: Contrast ratio (“color contrast”) User Story: Mr. Lee, Online shopper with color blindness Mr. Yunus, Retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss User Needs: Accessibility Requirements for People with Low Vision Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG Overview): Success Criteria relating to “contrast” Mobile Applicability: Information conveyed solely with color Text Transcript with Description of Visuals Audio Visual Web Accessibility Perspectives: Colors with Good Contrast Web Accessibility Perspectives: Colors with Good Contrast There's something about great design that allows it to go practically unnoticed. Signs with directions are shown. A woman is walking happily down the street. But it doesn't take much to make things confusing and frustrating. The signs change to have poor contrast. The woman now looks confused. Choosing colors with poor contrast makes navigating, reading and interacting a real pain She looks at a navigation app on her phone. Good design means sufficient contrast between foreground background and colors. That's not just text and images but links, icons, and buttons. The app has a button with low contrast that changes to become clear. If it's important enough to be seen, then it needs to be clear. And this is essential for people with low contrast sensitivity. Which becomes more common as we age. An older man on a sofa is looking at a tablet. He goes to read a message on his mobile phone. With good colors, websites and applications can be easier to use in more situations. Like in different lighting conditions. Sun glares on the phone but the text is still readable.

Video on Large Links, Buttons, and Controls Enable Audio Description This video information is available as a Text Transcript with Description of Visuals below. What is “Large Links, Buttons, and Controls”? The area for clicking and tapping controls must be large enough for people to activate them. This includes links, buttons, checkboxes, and other controls. Small controls, and controls that are placed too close to each other, are difficult for many people to use. This is particularly relevant on mobile devices with small screens. Who depends on this feature? People with physical disabilities who have reduced dexterity. What are the additional benefits? Content is more usable on touch screens, especially on smaller mobile devices. Content is more usable for people who are not experienced with the mouse or touch-pad on the computer they are using. Content is more usable in situations where the device cannot be held steady. What needs to happen for this to work? Design large controls or activation areas around the controls. (Increasing the font size of the control sometimes isn’t enough.) Provide adequate separation between selectable controls. Provide labels for controls, which enlarges the activation area in many browsers because the label for checkboxes and option buttons is also clickable. Learn more Accessibility Principle: Users can easily navigate, find content, and determine where they are Getting Started: Create designs for different viewport sizes Ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels Easy Check: Forms, labels, and errors User Story: Mr. Yunus, Retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG Overview): Success Criteria relating to “labels” Text Transcript with Description of Visuals Audio Visual Web Accessibility Perspectives: Large Links, Buttons, and Controls Web Accessibility Perspectives: Large Links, Buttons, and Controls Trying to hit a small target requires lots of effort. A woman tries to thread a needle but misses. Many websites and applications try to thread the needle. The woman fails to tap small links on a website. But on the Web, we can make areas for clicking and tapping easier to use. The links become larger in size and the woman now easily taps them. Which is handy on mobile devices especially when we might be moving around at the time. The woman is using a tablet while preparing a coffee. Which is critical for people with reduced dexterity. Another woman with a hand tremor is unable to navigate precisely with the mouse and fails to click small buttons on a website. Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all. The buttons become larger and the woman with the tremor is now able to click them.

    "text": "Web accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for all. Learn about the impact of accessibility and the benefits for everyone in a variety of situations. Video on Customizable Text Enable Audio Description This video information is available as a Text Transcript with Description of Visuals below. What is “Customizable Text”? Some users need to be able to change the way text is displayed so that they can read the text. This includes changing the size, spacing, font, color, and other text properties. When users change these properties, no information or functionality should be lost, and the text should re-flow so users don’t have to scroll horizontally to read sentences. Text customization is more than the zoom functionality, which only changes the text size. Who depends on this feature? People with low vision who are not using screen magnification software. People with some forms of dyslexia and other cognitive and learning disabilities who need a particular presentation of text to read it. What are the additional benefits? Content is more adaptable to smaller and larger screen sizes. Content is more adaptable to personal preferences and comfort. Content is more adaptable when translated, since words and sentences are different lengths in different languages. What needs to happen for this to work? Content must be properly designed and coded so that it can adapt to different customization settings. This includes using relative rather than absolute units for the size of fonts, controls, and other objects. Applications should use the operating system and web browser text settings. Websites and applications could also provide information to help users change their settings. Web browsers and other web tools need to provide users with text customization functionality. Learn more Accessibility Principle: Content can be presented in different ways Getting Started: Write code that adapts to the user’s technology Easy Check: Resize text User Story: Mr. Yunus, Retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss Ms. Olsen, Classroom student with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG Overview): Success Criteria relating to “text” User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG Overview): Provide text configuration Multi-Column Text Reflow Linearize Content User Needs: Accessibility Requirements for People with Low Vision Text Transcript with Description of Visuals Audio Visual Web Accessibility Perspectives: Customizable Text Web Accessibility Perspectives:Customizable Text What's right for you doesn't necessarily work for the next person. Toast with different levels of darkness. Customization isn't always just the question of preference though. Sometimes it's a necessity. Two men are sitting with a toaster between them. One of the men turns the toaster dial. Being able to adjust the text is crucial for people with low vision and dyslexia. A woman puts on glasses to read a website on her laptop. The woman is squinting at the website with small text and an unusual font. Properly coded websites and applications allow the text to be customized. For example, to change its size, spacing, font, and colors without loss of functions or clarity. The woman uses the web browsers settings to adjust the text size and style. It appears more legible and the woman is relieved. Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all. Cutback to the two men: One of the men takes a piece of toast out of the toaster.

Video on Keyboard Compatibility Enable Audio Description This video information is available as a Text Transcript with Description of Visuals below. What is “Keyboard Compatibility”? All functionality must be usable with the keyboard. That is, users can access and move between links, buttons, forms, and other controls using the Tab key and other keystrokes. Websites should not require a mouse; for example, pop-up calendars should also let users type in a date. Who depends on this feature? People with physical disabilities who cannot use the mouse. People who are blind, and cannot see the mouse pointer on the screen. People with chronic conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries (RSI), who should limit or avoid use of a mouse. What are the additional benefits? Content works for people with temporary limitations, such as a broken arm or broken mouse. What needs to happen for this to work? Native HTML controls, like links, buttons, and form elements, work with the keyboard by default and should be used where possible. Custom-made controls, CSS styles, and scripts that control interaction may need additional coding for keyboard compatibility. Ensure that the tab order is logical, to allow keyboard navigation around the content and controls. Provide a way for users to jump between blocks of content and controls.

Video on Clear Layout and Design Enable Audio Description This video information is available as a Text Transcript with Description of Visuals below. What is “Clear Layout and Design”? The different parts of a web page must be easy to locate and identify. This includes navigation menus, links, and text sections. These should be at predictable locations and consistently identified. Also form labels and instructions have to be clearly associated with their controls. Who depends on this feature? People with low vision who are using screen magnification and only see a portion of the screen at a time. People with cognitive and learning disabilities who need clarity and consistency to orient themselves on a website. What are the additional benefits? Content is more usable for people who are new to the particular website or application. Content is more usable for people who are not confident using computers and the web. Content is more usable for mobile device users who are seeing it on smaller screens, especially if they are in a hurry or distracted. Content and functionality is easier to locate and identify by most users. What needs to happen for this to work? Design clear structure, both visually and through the markup. For example, make it easy to distinguish sections such as navigation, group related controls in a form, and provide headers to identify groups of information. Provide consistent presentation and behavior of web pages across a website.

A man in a kitchen is looking for things to make a coffee. The man is frustrated about not finding what he is looking for. And the same applies to the Web. Good design involves good layout and that means a better user experience. The man rearranges the kitchen in a time-lapse. This includes clear headings, navigation bars, and consistent styling. The man is now browsing a badly laid out pizza delivery website and is shaking his head. Any web user will get frustrated with bad layout and design. A woman is using the same complex website with screen magnification. She only sees a portion of the screen at a time, so the website appears even more confusing. Complex layouts also make finding information difficult or impossible for people with visual disabilities. The woman is shaking her head and is unable to use that website. And they are confusing for people with cognitive and learning disabilities who need clarity and consistency of the presentation. The man calls a friend over to help. Bad design also impacts anyone who isn't particularly confident around computers. The friend is just as confused and navigates to a different, better pizza website. Web accessibility: Essential for some, useful for all. This second website is much clearer and easier to use. They are both happy. The woman using screen magnification has also used that website and is delightfully eating a pizza.

Video on Notifications and Feedback Enable Audio Description This video information is available as a Text Transcript with Description of Visuals below. What is “Notifications and Feedback”? Users need to know what is going on, and get appropriate feedback during interaction. For example, users need confirmation messages when actions are completed, such as when forms are submitted. Also, error messages must provide clear directions rather than confuse users. Who depends on this feature? People with some cognitive and learning disabilities, who may be easily confused by unexpected behavior and unclear error messages. People with partial sight and blindness, who rely on notifications, instructions, and errors messages to understand the context and interactions. What are the additional benefits? Content is more usable for people who are new to the particular website or application. Content is more usable for people who are not confident using computers and the web. Content is less confusing and daunting to everyone, regardless of skills. What needs to happen for this to work? Use clear and simple language to make error messages more understandable.

It's the same on the Web. Without clear notifications and feedback, people are quickly disorientated and confused. A man completes and submits a form on a website to get a rather blank screen with no confirmation of his submission. He looks confused. Especially error messages which are often complex and confusing. Another man receives a technical error message from a website registration form. It reads: &quot;Error ead#234532 invalid data&quot;. Yet making them understandable is usually quite simple. The error message changes to say: &quot;Invalid format, required format is 'day/month/year'.

Video on Text to Speech Enable Audio Description This video information is available as a Text Transcript with Description of Visuals below. What is “Text to Speech”? Many computers and mobile devices today have built in text-to-speech software. Some people with disabilities, including people who are blind, use specialized software called screen readers. Screen readers provide important functionality such as navigating through headings, speaking image alternatives, and identifying internal and external links. They can also highlight the text as it is being read aloud for people to see and hear the content at the same time. Content must be coded properly so that all of the functionality of the text-to-speech software works with the content. Who depends on this feature? People who are blind and cannot see what is on the screen. People who have partial sight (often legally blind) and cannot see certain types of content. People with dyslexia and other cognitive and learning disabilities who need to hear and see the text to better understand it. What are the additional benefits? Content can be read aloud for people who cannot read the written language. Content can be read aloud for people who prefer to listen, for example, while multi-tasking. What needs to happen for this to work? Use semantic HTML markup for structures such as headings, paragraphs, lists, forms, and tables. Provide text alternatives for images, icons, and other non-text content. Ensure keyboard compatibility, and ensure that text information is understandable without the visual context.

Elle souligne quelques points bloquants en accessibilité web qu’on rencontre fréquemment à cause de sites et d’outils web inaccessibles. Note : Cette page est illustrative et ne reflète pas tous les handicaps ni tous les points bloquants. Contenus de cette page Une variété de capacités Auditifs Cognitifs, neurologiques et troubles d’apprentissages Physiques Parole Visuels Une variété de capacités Il y a de nombreuses raisons pour lesquelles une personne peut expérimenter à des degrés divers des handicaps auditifs, cognitifs, physiques, de la parole et visuels. Par exemple, pour certaines personnes le handicap peut être congénital, ou dû à une maladie ou à un accident ; il peut aussi être apparu avec l’âge. Certaines personnes ne se considèrent pas comme ayant un handicap alors qu’elles sont atteintes de ce genre de limitations fonctionnelles. Plus d’informations sur la variété de capacités Chaque individu est unique. Les gens ont des capacités, des compétences, des outils, des préférences et des attentes diverses qui peuvent avoir un impact sur leur usage du Web. Par exemple, considérons les aspects suivants : Handicaps liés à l’âge : De nombreuses personnes développent des handicaps liés à l’âge. Bien qu’elles aient des besoins fonctionnels communs avec d’autres personnes atteintes de handicaps, il y a parfois des différences significatives dans leur utilisation des technologies d’assistance, dans le niveau de compétences informatiques ou dans leur usage du Web en général. Handicaps multiples : Certaines personnes combinent plusieurs handicaps, ce qui peut limiter leur capacité à interagir avec le Web. Par exemple une personne qui est sourde et qui a une mauvaise vision tirera profit de sous-titres pour le canal audio, mais seulement si elle peut ajuster la taille et la couleur de ces sous-titres. Problèmes de santé : Certaines personnes ont des problèmes de santé qui peuvent affecter leur endurance, leur dextérité ou leur concentration. Par exemple, elles peuvent ressentir de l’épuisement, de la douleur ou d’autres symptômes qui peuvent avoir un impact sur leur usage physique d’un ordinateur ou limiter la durée ou la portée de leur usage du Web. Capacités changeantes : Certaines personnes peuvent rencontrer des limitations fonctionnelles progressives ou récurrentes qui impactent leur usage du Web différemment à différents moments. Par exemple elles peuvent avoir besoin d’un outil d’assistance un jour, d’autres outils, voire d’aucun un autre jour, selon leur état. Handicaps temporaires : Certaines personnes peuvent traverser un handicap temporaire, par exemple à la suite d’un accident, d’une opération chirurgicale ou d’un traitement médical. Elles ne connaissent pas forcément l’accessibilité, ne savent pas forcément utiliser des aides à l’accessibilité, et peuvent même ne pas savoir de quoi elles ont besoin. Limitations liées au contexte : Certaines personnes peuvent subir des contraintes liées à leur environnement ou à d’autres aspects contextuels. Par exemple elles peuvent être dans un environnement bruyant et donc incapables d’écouter une piste audio, sous une forte lumière et donc incapables de voir un écran, ou elles peuvent ne pas avoir les moyens de se payer telle ou telle technologie. Les sites et les services web conçus pour une grande variété de capacités sont profitables à tous, même à ceux qui n’ont pas de handicap. Il est donc important de considérer une grande variété de besoins fonctionnels plutôt que de catégoriser les utilisateurs selon une nomenclature médicale. Auditifs Les handicaps auditifs vont de perte légère de l’audition dans une ou deux oreille(s) (« malentendance ») à une perte substantielle des deux oreilles, impossible à corriger (« surdité »). Certaines personnes atteintes de troubles auditifs peuvent entendre des sons mais pas forcément suffisamment pour comprendre la parole, en particulier dans un environnement bruyant. Cela peut inclure les personnes portant des aides auditives. Plus sur le handicap auditif Bien que le multimédia sur le Web fournisse de nombreuses possibilités aux personnes atteintes de handicap auditif, il pose aussi des difficultés quand le contenu n’a pas été conçu de façon accessible. Par exemple, une vidéo peut être utilisée pour véhiculer de l’information visuellement, le contenu audio associé doit exister sous formes alternatives, comme une transcription ou des sous-titres, afin d’être accessible à des personnes atteintes de handicap auditif. Pour pouvoir utiliser correctement le Web, les personnes atteintes de handicap auditif s’appuient souvent sur : Des transcriptions et des sous-titres des contenus audio, y compris des contenus uniquement audio et des pistes audio dans des contenus multimédia ; Des lecteurs de média qui affichent les sous-titres et donnent des options pour ajuster la taille et la couleur des sous-titres ; Des options pour arrêter, mettre en pause, et ajuster le volume du contenu audio (indépendantes du volume du système) ; Une piste audio de premier plan de bonne qualité, facilement distinguable de tout bruit de fond. Pour certaines personnes atteintes de handicap auditif, la langue des signes est la première langue, et elles peuvent ne pas lire couramment la langue écrite. Fournir les informations importantes en langue des signes et utiliser un texte plus simple accompagné d’images, de graphes et d’autres illustrations aide à rendre le contenu web plus compréhensible à plus de monde. Cependant il est important de se souvenir que toutes les personnes atteintes de handicap auditif ne maîtrisent pas la langue des signes. Exemples de handicaps auditifs Malentendance : légère à moyenne baisse de l’audition dans l’une ou les deux oreilles. Surdité : handicap substantiel impossible à corriger dans les deux oreilles. Surdité-cécité : handicaps auditif et visuel substantiels impossibles à corriger. Exemples de points bloquants pour des personnes atteintes de handicaps auditifs Du contenu audio, tel que des vidéos avec des voix et des sons, sans sous-titres ni transcription. Les lecteurs média qui n’affichent pas les sous-titres et ne proposent pas de contrôle du volume. Les lecteurs média qui ne permettent pas d’ajuster la taille et la couleur du texte des sous-titres. Les services web, y compris les applications web, qui s’appuient sur des interactions uniquement vocales. Le manque de langue des signes pour compléter l’information importante ou le texte qui est difficile à lire. Histoires liées aux handicaps auditifs Martine, étudiante en ligne, malentendante Kaseem, adolescente qui est sourde et aveugle Cognitifs, neurologiques et troubles d’apprentissages Les handicaps cognitifs, neurologiques, et les troubles d’apprentissage incluent les maladies neurologiques et la neurodiversité, ainsi que les troubles du comportement et la maladie mentale, qui ne sont pas forcément neurologiques. Ils peuvent affecter n’importe quelle partie du système nerveux et impacter la façon dont les gens entendent, bougent, voient, parlent et comprennent l’information. Les handicaps cognitifs, neurologiques, et les troubles d’apprentissage n’affectent pas nécessairement l’intelligence d’une personne. Plus sur les handicaps cognitifs, neurologiques, et les troubles d’apprentissage Les technologies informatiques et le Web fournissent de nombreuses occasions pour les personnes atteintes de handicaps cognitifs, neurologiques, et de troubles d’apprentissage d’interagir avec le contenu et de comprendre les informations d’une façon qui leur est plus utile. Par exemple, on peut parcourir les contenus web en suivant plusieurs stratégies, accéder à l’information sous forme textuelle, audio, ou dans d’autres formats, et changer la présentation du contenu selon ses propres besoins ou préférences. Selon leurs besoins individuels, les gens atteints de handicaps cognitifs, neurologiques, de troubles d’apprentissage s’appuient souvent sur : Du contenu clairement structuré qui facilite une vue d’ensemble et permet de s’orienter ; L’étiquetage cohérent des formulaires, des boutons et d’autres éléments de contenu ; Des cibles de liens, des fonctionnalités et d’une façon générale une interaction prévisibles ; Des options pour supprimer le clignotement régulier ou irrégulier, les changements subits et tout contenu qui peut distraire ; Du texte simple accompagné d’images, de graphes et autres illustrations. Les personnes atteintes de handicaps cognitifs, neurologiques, de troubles d’apprentissage peuvent avoir différentes méthodes pour parcourir les contenus web, selon leurs besoins particuliers. Par exemple certaines personnes utilisent des lecteurs d’écran pour entendre l’information en même temps qu’elles la lisent, ou utiliser les sous-titres pour lire l’information en même temps qu’elles l’entendent. Certaines personnes utilisent des outils qui redimensionnent le texte et l’espacement, ou personnalisent les couleurs pour se faciliter la lecture. D’autres utilisent des outils d’assistance grammaticale ou syntaxique pour écrire. Pour que ces méthodes de parcours du Web fonctionnent, il faut que les développeurs intègrent les exigences d’accessibilité web qui sont souvent les mêmes entre les publics atteints de handicaps auditifs, physiques, visuels ou de la parole. Exemples de handicaps cognitifs, neurologiques, de troubles d’apprentissage Trouble du déficit de l’attention avec ou sans hyperactivité (TDAH) : implique des difficultés à se concentrer sur une seule tâche, ou se concentrer sur de longues périodes, et une grande facilité à se laisser distraire. Trouble du spectre de l’autisme (TSA) (inclut « autisme », « syndrome d’Asperger » et « trouble envahissant du développement » (TED) : implique des difficultés de communication et d’interaction sociale, et quelquefois des habitudes et des intérêts limités. Handicaps intellectuels (parfois appelés « troubles d’apprentissage » en Europe et dans certains pays, ou « troubles du développement » dans d’autres régions) : implique des déficiences d’intelligence, une capacité d’apprentissage plus lente, ou des difficultés à comprendre des concepts complexes. Le syndrome de Down est une des nombreuses causes de handicaps intellectuels. Troubles d’apprentissage : c’est davantage un terme fonctionnel qu’une dénomination médicale, et ce n’est pas un terme défini uniformément. En Europe et dans certains pays il s’agit de handicaps intellectuels, tandis qu’en Australie, au Canada et aux USA et dans d’autres pays il s’agit de troubles de la perception. Handicaps liés à une maladie mentale : cela inclut l’anxiété, le delirium, la dépression, la paranoïa, la schizophrénie, et d’autres maladies. Elles peuvent causer des difficultés à se concentrer sur l’information, à la décoder et à la comprendre. En particulier la médication associée à ces maladies peut avoir des effets secondaires comme un flou visuel, un tremblement des mains, et d’autres déficiences. Déficiences de la mémoire : impliquent une mémoire à court terme limitée, une mémoire à long terme défectueuse, ou une capacité limitée à solliciter les capacités langagières. La démence est une des nombreuses causes de déficiences de la mémoire. Sclérose en plaques : abîme les cellules nerveuses du cerveau et de la moelle épinière, et peut affecter les capacités auditives, cognitives, physiques ou visuelle, en particulier pendant les rechutes. Neurodiversité : c’est un terme davantage sociétal que clinique, pour décrire la diversité naturelle des fonctionnements cognitifs, tels que le genre, l’ethnicité, l’orientation sexuelle et le handicap. Handicaps de perception (aussi appelés « Troubles d’apprentissage » en Australie, au Canada, aux USA et dans d’autres pays) : impliquent la difficulté à interpréter l’information auditive, tactile, visuelle ou autre information sensorielle. Ils peuvent impacter la lecture (dyslexie), l’écriture (dysgraphie), la perception des nombres (dyscalculie), ainsi que l’orientation spatiale ou temporelle. Troubles liés à des crises : incluent différents types d’épilepsie et de migraines, qui peuvent être en réaction à des vibrations lumineuses ou à des signaux audios à certaines fréquences, voire à des motifs visuels. Exemples de points bloquants pour des personnes atteintes de handicaps cognitifs, neurologiques, ou de troubles d’apprentissage Mécanismes de navigation et mises en page complexes qui sont difficiles à comprendre et à utiliser. Phrases complexes qui sont difficiles à lire, et mots peu fréquents qui sont difficiles à comprendre. De longs passages de textes sans images, sans graphes, sans illustrations pour compléter le contenu. Des contenus qui bougent, qui clignotent, un fond sonore qu’on ne peut pas désactiver. Des navigateurs web et des lecteurs média qui ne fournissent pas de mécanismes pour supprimer les animations ou la piste audio. Des designs visuels de pages qui ne peuvent pas être adaptés en utilisant les fonctionnalités du navigateur ou des feuilles de style personnalisées. Histoires liées aux handicaps cognitifs, neurologiques, ou aux troubles d’apprentissage Preety, élève de collège avec un trouble du déficit de l’attention avec hyperactivité et dyslexique Yun, retraité avec une mauvaise vue, un tremblement des mains, et une perte de mémoire à court terme Luis, assistant en supermarché, atteint du syndrome de Down Physiques Les handicaps physiques (parfois appelés « handicaps moteurs ») incluent les faiblesses et les limitations du contrôle musculaire (telles que des mouvements involontaires comme des spasmes, un manque de coordination, ou une paralysie), des limitations de la sensation, des maladies articulaires (telles que l’arthrite), la douleur qui gêne le mouvement, et les membres manquants. Plus sur les handicaps physiques Pour utiliser le Web, les personnes atteintes de handicaps physiques utilisent souvent des logiciels et des matériels spécialisés comme : Un clavier ou une souris ergonomique ou adapté ; Un pointeur opéré avec la tête, un bâtonnet buccal, et d’autres aides pour assister la frappe ; Un clavier virtuel avec une boule de commande (trackball), une poignée (joystick) ou un autre dispositif de pointage ; Un contacteur opéré au pied, à l’épaule, à la paille ou via un autre mouvement ; Un logiciel de reconnaissance vocale, d’oculométrie et autres solutions pour une interaction sans les mains. Les personnes atteintes de handicaps physiques peuvent avoir uniquement l’usage d’une souris ou d’un dispositif de pointage, ou uniquement d’un clavier ou assimilé pour manipuler l’ordinateur. Elles ont besoin que l’interaction au clavier soit disponible pour activer les fonctionnalités fournies sur les pages web. Elles peuvent avoir besoin de plus de temps pour taper, cliquer, ou pour accomplir une action, et elles peuvent aussi utiliser des séquences de touches plutôt que des combinaisons de touches pour activer des commandes. De telles manipulations incluent les commandes pour taper des caractères spéciaux, des raccourcis claviers, ou l’appel d’éléments de menus. Les personnes atteintes de handicaps physiques peuvent avoir des difficultés à cliquer sur des petites zones, et ont davantage tendance à faire des erreurs de frappe ou de clic. Il est important de fournir des grandes zones cliquables, de donner assez de temps pour accomplir une tâche, et des options de correction de saisie dans les formulaires. Parmi les autres décisions de design importantes, comptons : fournir des indicateurs visibles de la position du focus, et des mécanismes d’évitement de contenus, comme les zones d’en-tête de page ou les barres de navigation. Les personnes atteintes de handicaps cognitifs ou visuels partagent un grand nombre de ces exigences. Exemples de handicaps physiques Amputation : inclut doigts, membres ou autres parties du corps humain. Arthrite (précédemment appelée « rhumatisme ») : inflammation, dégénération ou dommage aux articulations. Fibromyalgie (précédemment appelée « rhumatisme ») : douleur chronique du tissu musculaire et articulaire. Rhumatisme : fait typiquement référence à l’arthrite et quelquefois à la fibromyalgie et à d’autres causes de douleurs musculaires et tissulaires. Dextérité réduite : il s’agit d’un terme fonctionnel (plutôt que d’une catégorie clinique) qui décrit la capacité à contrôler sa main, telle que la coordination œil-main de personnes atteintes de handicaps cognitifs et neurologiques. Dystrophie musculaire : faiblesse et dégénération musculaire progressives des muscles, incluant parfois bras et mains. Trouble musculosquelettique (appelé aussi « lésion articulaire due au travail répétitif » ou « trouble traumatique cumulatif ») : implique des blessures du système musculosquelettique (os, articulations, tendons, et autres tissu connectifs) et du système nerveux dues à un dégât lié à des tâches répétitives. Tremblements et spasmes : mouvements ou contractions musculaires involontaires, incluant des sursauts brefs, et des contractions continues ou rythmiques des muscles. Tétraplégie : paralysie partielle ou totale (inclut le contrôle et la sensation moteurs) des quatre membres (jambes et bras) et du torse. Exemples de points bloquants pour des personnes atteintes de handicaps physiques Des sites web, des navigateurs, des outils de production de contenu qui ne fournissent pas un support clavier complet. Des limites de temps insuffisantes pour répondre ou accomplir une tâche, telle que remplir un formulaire en ligne. Des éléments d’interaction, notamment des liens avec du texte en image, qui ne comportent pas d’équivalent textuel. Des indices de repérage visuels et non visuels manquants, des aides pour comprendre la structure de la page et naviguer inexistantes. Des mécanismes de navigation et des fonctionnalités de pages incohérents, imprévisibles ou trop compliqués. Histoires liées aux handicaps physiques Alex, journaliste avec un trouble musculosquelettique Yun, retraité avec une mauvaise vue, un tremblement des mains, et une perte de mémoire à court terme Parole Les handicaps liés à la parole incluent la difficulté à produire une parole reconnaissable par d’autres ou par un logiciel de reconnaissance vocale. Par exemple le volume ou la clarté d’une voix peuvent la rendre difficile à comprendre. Plus sur les handicaps liés à la parole Les personnes atteintes de handicaps liés à la parole rencontrent des difficultés avec les services basés sur la voix, tels que les services de support utilisateur automatisés et les applications opérées par des commandes vocales. Pour utiliser des services qui s’appuient sur la voix, les personnes atteintes de handicaps liés à la parole ont besoin de modes d’interaction alternatifs, comme un chat fondé sur du texte pour interagir avec un conseiller client, et des commandes au clavier pour faire fonctionner des applications web. De même, des sites web qui ne fournissent qu’un numéro de téléphone comme moyen de communication bloquent une personne atteinte d’un handicap de la parole. Des méthodes alternatives incluent une adresse de courrier électronique ou un formulaire de commentaire. Exemples de handicaps liés à la parole Apraxie de la parole : inclut une articulation et une production de son irrégulières, et des erreurs dans la production de sons dans le bon ordre, ce qui occasionne une difficulté à comprendre les mots et les phrases prononcés. Emballement (aussi appelé « tachyphémie ») : induit un débit de parole très élevé, un rythme et une intonation incorrects, une co-articulation de sons et autres problèmes de fluidité du langage, parfois similaires au bégaiement. Dysarthrie : implique une faiblesse ou une paralysie complète des muscles nécessaires à la production de la parole, incluant les lèvres, les poumons, la langue, et d’autres encore. Troubles des cordes vocales : implique une difficulté ou une incapacité à produire certains sons ou schémas sonores, et occasionne parfois l’addition, la distorsion, l’omission ou la substitution de ces sons avec d’autres. Bégaiement : inclut une irrégularité de parole, la répétition de sons individuels ou de mots ou de phrases entières, et le déplacement ou la prolongation de pauses et de sons pendant la parole, différents de l’emballement. Mutisme : implique l’incapacité à parler à cause de raisons variées dont l’anxiété, des dommages au cerveau, ou l’incapacité à entendre et à apprendre à parler. Exemples de points bloquants pour des personnes atteintes de handicaps liés à la parole Les services web, y compris les applications web, qui s’appuient sur des interactions uniquement vocales. Les sites web qui n’offrent qu’un numéro de téléphone comme seul moyen de contact avec l’organisation. Visuels Les handicaps visuels vont d’une perte de la vision légère ou modérée à un ou aux deux yeux (« malvoyance ») à une perte de la vision substantielle impossible à corriger aux deux yeux (« cécité »). Certaines personnes ont une sensibilité à certaines couleurs réduite ou absente (« daltonisme »), ou une sensibilité accrue aux couleurs vives. Ces variations dans la perception des couleurs et de la luminosité peuvent être indépendantes de l’acuité visuelle. Plus sur les handicaps visuels Les personnes atteintes de handicaps visuels s’appuient typiquement sur des changements de la présentation des contenus web dans des formes qui sont plus utilisables pour leurs besoins particuliers. Par exemple : Agrandir ou réduire la taille du texte et les images ; Personnaliser les réglages de polices, de couleurs et d’espacements ; Écouter une synthèse vocale lire le contenu ; Écouter l’audiodescription de vidéos multimédia ; Lire le texte sur une plage Braille. Pour que ces méthodes de consultation du Web fonctionnent, les développeurs doivent s’assurer que la présentation des contenus web est indépendante de sa structure sous-jacente et que la structure est correctement codée afin d’être interprétée et présentée sous différentes formes par les navigateurs et les technologies d’assistance. Par exemple, certaines personnes ne voient pas le contenu et comptent sur le bon codage des listes, des titres, des tableaux et d’autres structures de pages pour que les navigateurs et les techniques d’assistance puissent les identifier. Certaines personnes ne voient qu’une partie du contenu à la fois ou perçoivent les couleurs et le design différemment. Certaines personnes utilisent des polices, des couleurs et des espacements personnalisés pour rendre le contenu plus lisible, ou elles parcourent le contenu uniquement à l’aide d’un clavier parce qu’elles ne peuvent pas voir le pointeur de souris. Une conception accessible permet différentes présentations du contenu web et différentes façons d’interagir. Exemples de handicaps visuels Daltonisme : inclut des difficultés à différencier des couleurs comme le rouge et le vert, ou le jaune et le bleu, et parfois l’incapacité à percevoir la couleur en général. Malvoyance (dans certaines régions, aussi appelé « vision partielle ») : inclut une mauvaise acuité (vision imprécise), la vue en tunnel (ne voir que le milieu du champ visuel), la perte de la vision centrale (ne voir que la périphérie du champ visuel), et la vision partiellement obstruée. Cécité : perte substantielle impossible à corriger de la vision dans les deux yeux. Surdité-cécité : handicaps auditif et visuel substantiels impossibles à corriger. Exemples de points bloquants pour des personnes atteintes de handicaps visuels Des images, contrôles et autres éléments structurels qui ne comportent pas d’équivalent textuel. Des textes, images et mises en pages qui ne peuvent pas être redimensionnés, ou qui perdent de l’information quand on les redimensionne. Des indices de repérage visuels et non visuels manquants, des aides pour comprendre la structure de la page et naviguer inexistantes. Du contenu vidéo qui n’est pas accompagné d’alternative texte ou audio, ou d’une piste d’audiodescription. Des mécanismes de navigation et des fonctionnalités de pages incohérents, imprévisibles ou trop compliqués. Des textes et des images dont le contraste de couleurs entre le premier et l’arrière-plan est insuffisant. Des sites web, des navigateurs, des outils de production de contenu qui ne permettent pas de personnaliser les réglages de couleurs. Des sites web, des navigateurs, des outils de production de contenu qui ne fournissent pas un support clavier complet.

    "title": "Diverse Abilities and Barriers",
    "text": "Summary This page explores the wide diversity of people and abilities. It highlights some web accessibility barriers that people commonly experience because of inaccessible websites and web tools. Note: This page is illustrative and is not a complete list of all disabilities and barriers. Page Contents Diversity of abilities Auditory Cognitive, learning, and neurological Physical Speech Visual Diversity of abilities There are many reasons why people may be experiencing varying degrees of auditory, cognitive, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. For instance, some may have disabilities from birth, an illness, disease, or accident, or they may develop impairments with age. Some may not consider themselves to have disabilities even if they do experience such functional limitations. More about diversity of abilities Each individual is unique. People have diverse abilities, skills, tools, preferences, and expectations that can impact how they use the Web. For instance, consider the following aspects: Age-related impairments: Many people develop age-related impairments. While they share the same functional requirements as others with disabilities, sometimes there are significant differences in the use of assistive technologies, the level of computer skills, or in the use of the Web in general. Multiple disabilities: Some people have combinations of different kinds of disabilities, which may limit their approaches for interacting with the Web. For example, someone who is deaf and has low vision might benefit from captions for audio, but only if these captions have adjustable size and color. Health conditions: Some people have health conditions that may affect their stamina, dexterity, or concentration. For instance, some may experience fatigue, pain, or other symptoms that could have an impact on their physical use of the computer or limit the duration or extent of their use of the Web. Changing abilities: Some people may be experiencing progressive or recurring functional limitations that impact their use of the Web differently at different times. For example, some may need particular accessibility features on one day, and others or none on another day, depending on their condition. Temporary impairments: Some people may be experiencing temporary impairments such as those that may occur due to an accident, surgery, or medication. They may not know about accessibility solutions, may not know how to use accessibility features, and may be unaware of their needs. Situational limitations: Some people may be experiencing constraints due to their surrounding or due to other situational aspects. For example, they may be in a loud environment and unable to hear audio, in bright sunlight and unable to see a screen, or they may not be able to afford some technologies. Websites and web tools designed for people with a broad range of abilities benefit everyone, including people without disabilities. It is, therefore, important to consider the broad diversity of functional needs rather than to categorize people according to medical classifications. Auditory Auditory disabilities range from mild or moderate hearing loss in one or both ears (“hard of hearing”) to substantial and uncorrectable hearing loss in both ears (“deafness”). Some people with auditory disabilities can hear sounds but sometimes not sufficiently to understand all speech, especially when there is background noise. This can include people using hearing aids. More about auditory disabilities While multimedia on the Web provides many opportunities for people with auditory disabilities, it also poses challenges when content is not designed to be accessible. For example, while video content can be used to communicate information visually, audio content needs to have alternatives, such as transcripts and captions, so that it is accessible for people with auditory disabilities. To use the Web effectively, people with auditory disabilities often rely on: Transcripts and captions of audio content, including audio-only content and audio tracks in multimedia; Media players that display captions and provide options to adjust the text size and colors of captions; Options to stop, pause, and adjust the volume of audio content (independently of the system volume); High-quality foreground audio that is clearly distinguishable from any background noise. For some people with auditory disabilities, sign language is the primary language, and they may not read the written language as fluently. Providing important information in sign language and using simpler text that is supplemented by images, graphs, and other illustrations help make web content more understandable to many people. However, it is important to remember that not all people with auditory disabilities know sign language. Examples of auditory disabilities Hard of hearing – mild or moderate hearing impairments in one or both ears. Deafness – substantial, uncorrectable impairment of hearing in both ears. Deaf-blindness – substantial, uncorrectable hearing and visual impairments. Examples of barriers for people with auditory disabilities Audio content, such as videos with voices and sounds, without captions or transcripts. Media players that do not display captions and that do not provide volume controls. Media players that do not provide options to adjust the text size and colors for captions. Web-based services, including web applications, that rely on interaction using voice only. Lack of sign language to supplement important information and text that is difficult to read. Stories related to auditory disabilities Martine, online student who is hard of hearing Kaseem, teenager who is deaf and blind Cognitive, learning, and neurological Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities involve neurodiversity and neurological disorders, as well as behavioral and mental health disorders that are not necessarily neurological. They may affect any part of the nervous system and impact how well people hear, move, see, speak, and understand information. Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities do not necessarily affect the intelligence of a person. More about cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities Computer technologies and the Web provide many opportunities for people with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities to interact with content and to process information in ways that are more usable to them. For example, people can navigate web content using different strategies, access information in text, audio, or other formats, and change the presentation of the content according to their individual needs or preferences. Depending on the individual needs, people with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities often rely on: Clearly structured content that facilitates overview and orientation; Consistent labeling of forms, buttons, and other content parts; Predictable link targets, functionality, and overall interaction; Different ways of navigating websites, such as hierarchical menu and search; Options to suppress blinking, flickering, flashing, and otherwise distracting content; Simpler text that is supplemented by images, graphs, and other illustrations; People with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities use different types of web browsing methods, depending on their particular needs. For example, some people use text-to-speech software to hear the information while reading it visually or use captions to read the information while hearing it. Some people use tools that resize text and spacing or customize colors to assist reading. Others use grammar and spelling tools to support writing. For these web browsing methods to work, developers need to consider web accessibility requirements which are often shared by people with hearing, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. Examples of cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (formerly “attention deficit disorder (ADD)”) – involves difficulty focusing on a single task, focusing for longer periods, or being easily distracted. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (includes “autism,” “Asperger syndrome,” and “pervasive developmental disorder” (PDD)) - involves impairments of social communication and interaction abilities, and sometimes restricted habits and interests. Intellectual disabilities (sometimes called “learning disabilities” in Europe and some other countries, and “developmental disabilities” in other regions) – involves impairments of intelligence, learning more slowly, or difficulty understanding complex concepts. Down syndrome is one among many different causes of intellectual disabilities. Learning disabilities – is a functional term rather than a medical condition, and is not uniformly defined. In Europe and some other countries, it refers to intellectual disabilities, while in Australia, Canada, the U.S., and some other countries it refers to perceptual disabilities. Mental health disabilities – includes anxiety, delirium, depression, paranoia, schizophrenia, and many other disorders. These conditions may cause difficulty focusing on information, processing information, or understanding it. In particular medication for these disorders may have side effects including blurred vision, hand tremors, and other impairments. Memory impairments – involves limited short-term memory, missing long-term memory, or limited ability to recall language. Dementia is one among many different causes of memory impairments. Multiple sclerosis – causes damage to nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, and can affect auditory, cognitive, physical, or visual abilities, in particular during relapses. Neurodiversity – is a societal rather than medical term to describe the natural diversity in neurocognitive functioning, like gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and disability. Perceptual disabilities (sometimes called “learning disabilities” in Australia, Canada, the U.S., and some other countries) – involves difficulty processing auditory, tactile, visual, or other sensory information. This can impact reading (dyslexia), writing (dysgraphia), processing numbers (dyscalculia), or spatial and temporal orientation. Seizure disorders – includes different types of epilepsy and migraines, which may be in reaction to visual flickering or audio signals at certain frequencies or patterns. Examples of barriers for people with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities Complex navigation mechanisms and page layouts that are difficult to understand and use. Complex sentences that are difficult to read and unusual words that are difficult to understand. Long passages of text without images, graphs, or other illustrations to highlight the context. Moving, blinking, or flickering content, and background audio that cannot be turned off. Web browsers and media players that do not provide mechanisms to suppress animations and audio. Visual page designs that cannot be adapted using web browser controls or custom style sheets. Stories related to cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities Preety, middle school student with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Dyslexia Yun, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss Luis, supermarket assistant with Down syndrome Physical Physical disabilities (sometimes called “motor disabilities”) include weakness and limitations of muscular control (such as involuntary movements including tremors, lack of coordination, or paralysis), limitations of sensation, joint disorders (such as arthritis), pain that impedes movement, and missing limbs. More about physical disabilities To use the Web, people with physical disabilities often use specialized hardware and software such as: Ergonomic or specially designed keyboard or mouse; Head pointer, mouth stick, and other aids to help with typing; On-screen keyboard with trackball, joysticks, or other pointing devices; Switches operated by foot, shoulder, sip-and-puff, or other movements; Voice recognition, eye tracking, and other approaches for hands-free interaction. People with physical disabilities may be using a mouse or mouse-like device only, or keyboard or keyboard-like device only to operate the computer. People with physical disabilities rely on keyboard support to activate functionality provided on web pages. They may need more time to type, click, or carry out other interaction, and they may type single keystrokes in sequence rather than typing simultaneous keystrokes (“chording”) to activate commands. Such keystrokes include commands for special characters, shortcut keys, and to active menu items. People with physical disabilities may have trouble clicking small areas and are more likely to make mistakes in typing and clicking. Providing large clickable areas, enough time to complete tasks, and error correction options for forms are important design aspects. Other important design aspects include providing visible indicators of the current focus, and mechanisms to skip over blocks, such as over page headers or navigation bars. People with cognitive and visual disabilities share many of these requirements. Examples of physical disabilities Amputation – includes missing fingers, limbs, or other parts of the human body. Arthritis (previously called “rheumatism”) – inflammation, degeneration, or damage to the joints. Fibromyalgia (formerly called “rheumatism”) – the chronic pain of muscle and connective tissues. Rheumatism – typically refers to arthritis and other causes of bone or joint pain, and sometimes to fibromyalgia and other causes for muscular and other soft tissue pain. Reduced dexterity – is a functional term (rather than a medical condition) that describes the ability to control the hand, such as hand-eye coordination of people with cognitive and neurological disabilities. Muscular dystrophy – progressive weakness and degeneration of muscles, sometimes including in arms and hands. Repetitive stress injury (RSI) (also called “repetitive motion disorder” (RMD) and “cumulative trauma disorder” (CT)) - involves injuries to the musculoskeletal system (bones, joints, tendons, and other connective tissues) and the nervous system from repetitive tasks and damage. Tremor and spasms – involuntary movement or muscle contraction, including short twitches, and continual or rhythmic muscle contractions. Quadriplegia (sometimes called “tetraplegia”) - partial or total paralysis (includes motor control and sensation) to all four body limbs (legs and arms) and the torso. Examples of barriers for people with physical disabilities Websites, web browsers, and authoring tools that do not provide full keyboard support. Insufficient time limits to respond or to complete tasks, such as to fill out online forms. Controls, including links with images of text, that do not have equivalent text alternatives. Missing visual and non-visual orientation cues, page structure, and other navigational aids. Inconsistent, unpredictable, and overly complicated navigation mechanisms and page functions. Stories related to physical disabilities Alex, reporter with repetitive stress injury Yun, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss Speech Speech disabilities include difficulty producing speech that is recognizable by others or by voice recognition software. For example, the loudness or clarity of someone’s voice might be difficult to understand. More about speech disabilities People with speech disabilities encounter barriers with voice-based services, such as automated web-based hotlines and web applications that are operated using voice commands. To use services that rely on voice, people with speech disabilities need alternative modes of interaction such as a text-based chat to interact with hotline representatives and keyboard commands to operate web applications. Also, websites that provide telephone numbers as the only means of communicating with an organization pose barriers for people with speech disabilities. Alternative means of communication include e-mail and feedback forms. Examples of speech disabilities Apraxia of speech (AOS) – includes inconsistent articulation and production of speech sounds, and errors producing sounds in the correct order so that spoken words or phrases become difficult to understand. Cluttering (also called “tachyphemia”) – includes increased speaking rate, incorrect rhythm, intonation, and co-articulation of sounds, and other influent speech that is sometimes similar to stuttering. Dysarthria – involves weakness or complete paralysis of muscles that are necessary to produce speech, including lips, lungs, throat, tongue, and others. Speech sound disorder – involves difficulty or inability to produce certain sounds or patterns of sound and sometimes results in addition, distortion, omission, or substitution of such sounds with others. Stuttering – includes influent speech, repetition of individual sounds or entire words and phrases, and misplacement or prolongation of pauses and sounds while speaking that is different from cluttering. Muteness (also called “mutism”) – involves the inability to speak due to various reasons such as anxiety, brain injuries, or inability to hear and learn speech. Examples of barriers for people with speech disabilities Web-based services, including web applications, that rely on interaction using voice only. Websites that offer phone numbers as the only way to communicate with the organizations. Visual Visual disabilities range from mild or moderate vision loss in one or both eyes (“low vision”) to substantial and uncorrectable vision loss in both eyes (“blindness”). Some people have reduced or lack of sensitivity to certain colors (“color blindness”), or increased sensitivity to bright colors. These variations in perception of colors and brightness can be independent of the visual acuity. More about visual disabilities People with visual disabilities typically rely on changing the presentation of web content into forms that are more usable for their particular needs. For example by: Enlarging or reducing text size and images; Customizing settings for fonts, colors, and spacing; Listening to text-to-speech synthesis of the content; Listening to audio descriptions of video in multimedia; Reading text using refreshable Braille. For these web browsing methods to work, developers need to ensure that the presentation of web content is independent of its underlying structure and that the structure is correctly coded so that it can be processed and presented in different ways by web browsers and assistive technologies. For example, some people do not see the content and rely on lists, headings, tables, and other page structures to be properly coded so that they can be identified by web browsers and assistive technologies. Some people are only seeing small portions of the content at a time or are perceiving the colors and design differently. Some people are using customized fonts, colors, and spacing to make the content more readable, or they are navigating through the content using keyboard only because they cannot see the mouse pointer. An accessible design supports different presentations of the web content and different ways of interaction. Examples of visual disabilities Color blindness – includes difficulty distinguishing between colors such as between red and green, or between yellow and blue, and sometimes inability to perceive any color. Low vision – (in some regions also called “partial sight”) includes poor acuity (vision that is not sharp), tunnel vision (seeing only the middle of the visual field), central field loss (seeing only the edges of the visual field), and clouded vision. Blindness – substantial, uncorrectable loss of vision in both eyes. Deaf-blindness – substantial, uncorrectable visual and hearing impairments. Examples of barriers for people with visual disabilities Images, controls, and other structural elements that do not have equivalent text alternatives. Text, images, and page layouts that cannot be resized, or that lose information when resized. Missing visual and non-visual orientation cues, page structure, and other navigational aids. Video content that does not have text or audio alternatives, or an audio-description track. Inconsistent, unpredictable, and overly complicated navigation mechanisms and page functions. Text and images with insufficient contrast between foreground and background color combinations. Websites, web browsers, and authoring tools that do not support the use of custom color combinations. Websites, web browsers, and authoring tools that do not provide full keyboard support.

    "text": "Summary The following stories of people with disabilities using the Web highlight the effect of accessibility barriers and the broader benefits of accessible websites and web tools. Note: The following scenarios are not real people. They do not address every kind of disability. Page Contents Lee, user with color perception deficiency Lee, user with color perception deficiency user quote Lee loves his clothes and his football. He uses loads of apps to help him indulge in both interests. Being red/green colour blind Lee faces problems when online shops don’t describe colours well enough. Depending on who his team are playing he might have difficulty watching a game or following highlights because it is hard to tell the players apart based on strip. More about Lee Lee works in the financial industry. Generally he has no difficulty in his work but when data is presented in charts or graphs he is often unable to interpret the information as colleagues often only use colour to identify graph lines or bars in charts. Ellen, his co-worker, had put red and green sectors adjacent to each other. Lee mixed them up because the data were described by colour only. As a result, the presentation he prepared based on the data drew incorrect conclusions. He was lucky that Ellen had another look at the slides. But it took some time to rewrite the whole thing. When shopping online it is difficult for Lee to make product choices when color swatches are not labeled with the name of the color. This can be frustrating as he sometimes takes a chance only to face confused looks at his style choices and having to send items back. Having colour names on swatches help but it is good when it is also included in product selection. Lee sometimes has difficulty with error messages and required fields. When red is used to indicate an error or Mark required field it is difficult for him to notice this. Thankfully many sites use a marker like an asterisk to show what is required. Some also use icons beside the field to show where an error is. Top barriers Color is used to signify meaning Top needs Sufficient contrast used for text and background colors Sufficient contrast used for adjacent colors Assistive technologies and adaptive strategies used Customized fonts and colors – changing the font types, sizes, colors, and spacing to make text easier to read. Customization involves browser settings and, for more advanced users, cascading style sheets (CSS) to override the default appearance of web content.

    "text": "Résumé Cette page introduit quelques techniques et outils que les personnes atteintes de handicaps utilisent pour interagir avec le Web : réglages de navigateurs, synthèse vocale, reconnaissance vocale et bien d’autres. Note : Cette page est illustrative et n’est pas une liste exhaustive de toutes les façons qu’ont les gens d’interagir avec le Web. Page Contents Outils et préférences Perception – audition, sensation et vision Présentation – distinguer et comprendre Saisie : taper, écrire, et cliquer Interaction : naviguer et trouver Outils et préférences Les personnes atteintes de handicaps accèdent au Web et y naviguent de différentes façons, selon leurs besoins et leurs préférences individuels. Certaines fois elles configurent des logiciels et des matériels génériques selon leurs besoins, tandis que d’autres utilisent des logiciels et matériels spécialisés pour les aider à accomplir certaines tâches. Plus sur outils et préférences Parmi les approches les plus communes pour interagir avec le Web on compte : Technologies d’assistance : logiciels et matériels utilisés par des personnes en situation de handicap pour améliorer leurs interactions avec le Web. Cela inclut les lecteurs d’écran qui vocalisent les pages web pour les personnes qui ne peuvent pas lire le texte, les loupes d’écran pour certains types de malvoyance, les logiciels de reconnaissance vocale et les contacteurs pour les personnes qui ne peuvent pas utiliser un clavier ou une souris. Stratégies d’adaptation : techniques que les personnes atteintes de handicaps mettent en place pour améliorer leurs interactions avec le Web, telles que le grossissement de caractères, la réduction de la vitesse du pointeur de souris, et l’affichage des sous-titres. Les stratégies d’adaptation incluent les techniques appliquées aux logiciels standards avec des navigateurs grand public autant qu’aux technologies d’assistance. L’accessibilité bénéficie à tout le monde, avec ou sans handicap. La prise en compte de l’accessibilité est de plus en plus courante dans les ordinateurs, les téléphones, les systèmes d’opération, les navigateurs et autres outils. Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your Computer (« Mieux naviguer sur le Web : conseils pour personnaliser votre ordinateur ») donne des informations pour personnaliser votre ordinateur afin de tirer avantage de telles solutions pour l’accessibilité. Les matériels ou les logiciels qui fournissent des fonctionnalités d’accessibilité, notamment les navigateurs, les lecteurs média, ou les technologies d’assistance, peuvent ne pas être disponibles pour certaines personnes. Par exemple certains outils peuvent être trop chers, pas installés ou pas compatibles avec l’ordinateur, pas disponibles dans certaines langues, ou indisponibles pour d’autres raisons. Dans d’autres cas, les personnes ne sont pas au courant des solutions accessibles, ou de comment les configurer ou les utiliser. Perception – audition, sensation et vision Les gens perçoivent le contenu à travers divers sens selon leurs besoins et leurs préférences. Par exemple, certaines personnes ne voient pas l’écran ou n’entendent pas le son. Quelques exemples de perceptions : Auditive telle que la parole, la musique, et le son qui peuvent être entendus. Tactile telle que les picots, les lignes et les vibrations qui peuvent être sentis. Visuelle telle que les images, le texte et la vidéo qui peuvent être vus. Plus sur la perception Certaines personnes doivent convertir du contenu d’une forme à l’autre pour le percevoir. Par exemple, une personne sourde-aveugle a besoin de convertir le contenu audio et visuel dans une forme tactile (comme le braille). D’autres personnes ont besoin de percevoir le contenu à travers plusieurs sens, par exemple une personne dyslexique aura besoin d’entendre et de voir le texte pour mieux le comprendre. Le contenu sous forme textuelle peut plus facilement être converti dans d’autres formes et est donc particulièrement utile. Cependant le contenu en texte seul pose de gros problèmes à de nombreuses personnes qui ont des difficultés avec le langage écrit. Les graphiques et les illustrations peuvent être rendus accessibles et rendent souvent les sites web et les applications plus compréhensibles, plus faciles à utiliser et plus satisfaisants pour tout le monde. Dans certains cas, le contenu peut être converti dans d’autres formes grâce à des logiciels ou des matériels. Par exemple un logiciel de lecture d’écran peut convertir le texte en parole. Dans d’autres cas, les auteurs de contenus doivent fournir des formes alternatives de contenus. Par exemple, il faut au moins une intervention humaine pour créer des descriptions textuelles pour des images ou pour sous-titrer des contenus audio. Quelquefois des logiciels, par exemple de reconnaissance de voix ou d’image, peuvent assister les auteurs à fournir de telles alternatives, mais la conversion n’est le plus souvent pas complètement automatisable. Exemples de techniques d’accessibilité Audiodescription (aussi appelée « description vidéo » ou « vidéo décrite ») : narration qui décrit les détails visuels importants d’une vidéo. Ces narrations peuvent s’insérer dans les pauses naturelles de la piste son, ou être sur une piste audio séparée dans le fichier multimédia, ou dans un fichier son séparé. Notifications auditives, tactiles ou visuelles : notifier l’utilisateur ou l’alerter de différentes manières, avec un clignotement, un dialogue visuel qui apparaît, un son, ou une vibration. Braille : une matrice utilisant six à huit points élevés ou baissés selon différents schémas, pour représenter des lettres et des chiffres. Ces caractères sont lus en parcourant les points élevés du bout des doigts. Le braille est utilisé par des personnes aveugles, mais toutes les personnes aveugles ne connaissent pas le braille. Sous-titres : texte rapportant un verbatim de toutes les paroles et décrivant l’information auditive pertinente, qui apparaît en même temps que l’audio (y compris l’audio qui accompagne la vidéo dans le multimédia). Le sous-titrage en temps réel nécessite typiquement des interprètes professionnels. Synthèse vocale (aussi appelé « sortie vocale ») : conversion automatique de texte en une voix synthétique qui lit le texte à voix haute. Transcriptions : manuscrits textuels contenant la séquence verbatim de la parole enregistrée ainsi que la description de l’information auditive ou visuelle importante. Exemples de technologies d’assistance et de stratégies d’adaptation Afficheur braille : un terminal mécanique qui affiche une ligne de caractères braille (souvent 40 à 80) en élevant et baissant dynamiquement des picots (des points). Les assistants braille, qui ont la capacité de petits ordinateurs, sont équipés d’afficheurs braille. Ces terminaux peuvent être utilisés pour prendre des notes, faire des calculs, ou s’interfacer avec d’autres outils comme les kiosques publics d’information. Lecteur d’écran : logiciel qui interprète le contenu du bureau et dans le navigateur web, et le convertit dans d’autres formes comme de la voix ou du braille. Les lecteurs d’écran fournissent généralement d’autres fonctions, comme des raccourcis clavier, plusieurs moyens d’interpréter le contenu et d’interagir avec lui, et la capacité de surligner le texte qui est en cours de vocalisation. Navigateur vocal : similaire à un lecteur d’écran mais n’interprète souvent que les contenus web. Les navigateurs vocaux ne sont généralement pas développés en tant qu’outils d’assistance mais comme alternatives à des navigateurs web pour des téléphones mobiles et d’autres usages similaires. Histoires liées à la perception Martine, étudiante en ligne, malentendante Ilya, cadre supérieure, aveugle Preety, élève de collège avec un trouble du déficit de l’attention avec hyperactivité et dyslexique Kaseem, adolescente qui est sourde et aveugle Présentation – distinguer et comprendre Les gens adaptent la présentation des contenus pour les rendre plus faciles à distinguer et à comprendre. Quelques exemples d’adaptations : Rendre le contenu audio plus facile à écouter et le contenu visuel plus facile à voir ; combiner le contenu audio et visuel pour rendre l’information plus facile à comprendre ; fournir des présentations alternatives du contenu, par exemple en langue des signes. Plus sur la présentation Certaines personnes ont besoin de texte et d’images plus grands, ou d’un plus grand contraste entre le texte et le fond pour mieux voir le contenu, et certaines personnes ont besoin d’un son plus fort avec moins de bruit de fond pour mieux entendre le contenu. Certaines personnes doivent désactiver le contenu surgissant (« pop-ups ») et les animations, qui les désorientent et les distraient. Un son qui est joué automatiquement, comme une musique de fond sur un site web, peut aussi distraire les gens ou interférer avec leur lecteur d’écran. Les contenus web, les navigateurs et les outils doivent permettre d’ajuster la présentation selon les besoins et les préférences des utilisateurs. Rendre le texte plus lisible est particulièrement important. Cela signifie qu’on peut changer son apparence visuelle, utiliser un lecteur d’écran, et adapter le contenu. Par exemple changer la police d’affichage, les couleurs, les espacements, et les largeurs de lignes rend le texte plus lisible pour de nombreuses personnes. Parfois la synthèse vocale est utilisée en complément de la lecture visuelle. Adapter le contenu signifie aussi réarranger des sections de la page web, ajouter des fonctionnalités telles que des dictionnaires et des glossaires, et cacher des fonctionnalités moins utilisées. Bien que ces changements soient souvent effectués par de navigateurs et des outils spécialisés, les auteurs de sites web doivent fournir un code adéquat pour permettre ces ajustements et ces adaptations. De même, tout le monde n’interprète pas l’information de la même manière. Cet aspect est particulièrement pertinent dans un environnement dédié à l’apprentissage, mais il s’applique aussi à de nombreuses autres situations. Dans certains cas, les auteurs peuvent fournir différentes représentations de la même information pour la servir au plus grand public possible, par exemple une représentation graphique et tabulaire de donnée selon le mode d’apprentissage, ou une vidéo en langue des signes pour des personnes qui la parlent. Exemples de techniques d’accessibilité Polices et couleurs personnalisées : changer les polices de caractères, les tailles, les couleurs, les espacements pour rendre le texte plus facile à lire. La personnalisation inclut les réglages du navigateur et, pour les utilisateurs avancés, des feuilles de style (CSS) pour surcharger l’apparence par défaut du contenu web. Plan du document : représentation du contenu qui ne montre que les titres et les structures pertinentes (comme la hiérarchie de titres) pour permettre de s’orienter et d’avoir une vue synthétique du contenu. Texte facile à lire : résumés simplifiés de passages du texte pour les rendre plus faciles à comprendre. Révélation progressive : technique de design qui implique de ne montrer que le minimum d’informations ou de fonctions nécessaires pour une tâche ou un but donné, pour éviter de surcharger l’utilisateur d’informations. Interface réduite : représentation du contenu qui ne montre que les informations les plus pertinentes ou les fonctions les plus fréquentes, par exemple en cachant les parties du contenu qui peuvent distraire l’utilisateur. Agrandissement d’écran : changer les réglages du navigateur, du système ou de l’écran pour élargir ou réduire la taille du texte et les images. Certaines personnes utilisent des loupes, des jumelles, ou d’autres aides visuelles, et des logiciels comme des loupes d’écran pour mieux voir les contenus. Langue des signes : une forme de communication visuelle qui est principalement utilisée par les personnes sourdes. Elle implique la main, le corps et les expressions faciales pour transmettre des mots, des phrases et des tonalités. Par exemple, l’intensité d’un geste pour indiquer l’émotion ou permettre d’insister sur une information particulière. Comme dans les langues écrites, il y a de nombreuses langues des signes et dialectes, dont certaines sont reconnues comme des langues officielles dans certains pays. Toutes les personnes qui ont un handicap visuel ou qui sont sourdes ne parlent pas la langue des signes. Symboles : des icônes qui représentent les mots ou les concepts utilisés à la place de texte par certaines personnes qui ont des problèmes de communication, comme les personnes qui ont du mal à lire et à écrire. Exemples de technologies d’assistance et de stratégies d’adaptation Bloqueurs d’animations et de pop-ups : modules d’extension (plugins) de navigateurs et autres outils logiciels qui arrêtent les fenêtres surgissantes automatiques et les redirections, et fournissent des options pour arrêter, mettre en pause ou cacher les animations. Assistants à la lecture : logiciels qui change la présentation du contenu et fournissent d’autres fonctionnalités pour le rendre plus lisible. Par exemple : Personnaliser la police de caractères, la taille, l’espacement, les couleurs de premier et d’arrière-plan ; Analyser le texte et trouver les mots et expressions complexes, les lier à des glossaires ; Cacher les parties moins pertinentes du contenu, telles que les barres de navigation et les zones d’en-tête ; Fournir un plan de la page et un résumé des passages de texte ; Lire le contenu à voix haute et surligner le texte à mesure qu’il est lu. Loupe d’écran : logiciel principalement utilisé par des personnes dont la vision est partielle, pour agrandir les contenus et les rendre plus faciles à voir. Certaines loupes d’écran fournissent une synthèse vocale et d’autres fonctionnalités. Contrôle du volume : options pour ajuster le volume des contenus audios, y compris pour couper le son complètement, qui sont séparées des réglages généraux du système. Histoires liées à la présentation Lee, client de site Web marchand, daltonien Martine, étudiante en ligne, malentendante Preety, élève de collège avec un trouble du déficit de l’attention avec hyperactivité et dyslexique Yun, retraité avec une mauvaise vue, un tremblement des mains, et une perte de mémoire à court terme Luis, assistant en supermarché, atteint du syndrome de Down Kaseem, adolescente qui est sourde et aveugle Saisie : taper, écrire, et cliquer Les gens utilisent différentes approches pour entrer du texte et activer des commandes. Par exemple certaines personnes n’utilisent pas de souris, de clavier, ou ni l’un ni l’autre, tandis que d’autres utilisent une configuration spécifique de clavier et de souris, ou utilisent des matériels et des logiciels complètement différents. Quelques exemples d’interfaces de saisie : Utilisation exclusive du clavier par des personnes atteintes de handicaps cognitifs, physiques et visuels ; Écran tactile seul pour des personnes atteintes de handicaps cognitifs et physiques ; Souris et clavier avec un logiciel compensant le tremblement ; Reconnaissance vocale (entrée de texte) et autres interactions sans les mains. Plus sur la saisie Certaines personnes utilisent des logiciels et des réglages personnalisés pour améliorer leur efficacité pour taper, écrire et cliquer. Par exemple certaines personnes assignent des raccourcis clavier personnalisés aux fonctions qu’elles utilisent fréquemment. Certaines personnes utilisent des logiciels d’écriture prédictive afin de taper des mots et des phrases avec le moins de frappe possible, des outils de vérification orthographique et grammaticale pour aider à corriger le texte, et des outils pour aider à cliquer, sélectionner le texte, et faire défiler l’écran avec le moins de mouvement possible. Le contenu web doit être conçu pour permettre ces différentes approches. Par exemple, les formulaires, les liens, et autres fonctionnalités doivent être utilisables au clavier. En particulier, les applications web (« script côté client ») les lecteurs média, et autres objets programmatiques doivent fournir un support clavier complet qui ne piège pas le focus clavier dans le programme, ainsi que des grandes formes cliquables pour les boutons et les liens. Un contenu web accessible est utilisable par les personnes qui ont besoin de plus de temps pour taper, écrire et cliquer, ou qui sont susceptibles de faire des fautes. Par exemple, certaines personnes oublient de sélectionner des options en remplissant des formulaires, orthographient mal les mots et fournissent de mauvaises données (des dates, notamment), ou activent malgré elles des boutons et des liens. Un contenu accessible doit aussi fournir assez de temps pour accomplir les tâches, et fournir aussi des messages d’erreur clairs et utiles, ainsi que des options pour corriger la saisie. Exemples de technologies d’assistance et de stratégies d’adaptation Accélérateurs : logiciels et fonctionnalités qui réduisent l’effort nécessaire à la frappe et au clic. Par exemple en fournissant des options pour créer des raccourcis pour des commandes ou des séquences de commandes, en surlignant les choix possibles tels que les items de menu, les liens ou les options, et en aidant à diriger la souris. Clavier et souris alternatifs : logiciel et matériel principalement utilisés par des personnes atteintes de handicaps cognitifs et physiques pour interagir avec l’ordinateur. Par exemple : Un clavier avec des touches plus grosses, des étiquettes sur les touches, un espaceur de touches, des touches illuminées, ou une disposition particulière ; Un clavier virtuel, un écran tactile, un contacteur à la paille, et un contacteur à une touche ; Une boule de commande (trackball), une poignée (joystick), un pavé tactile (touchpad), une souris spécialement conçue, et autres outils de pointage ; Un logiciel de reconnaissance vocale, ou d’oculométrie, et autres méthodes d’interaction sans les mains. Oculométrie (aussi appelé « eye-tracking ») : un système qui suit le mouvement des yeux pour contrôler le pointeur de souris et qui détecte le clignement pour déclencher des clics de souris. Personnalisation du clavier : permet le changement de la disposition des touches, l’assignation de raccourcis pour des fonctions, le réglage de filtres et l’usage de « touches rémanentes » pour permettre la frappe à une seule main. Filtres de clavier et de souris : fonctions du système ou de logiciels spécialisés, qui reconnaissent et compensent les mouvements involontaires tels que les tremblements ou les spasmes. Personnalisation de la souris : inclut de changer l’ordre des boutons, changer la sensibilité de la souris au mouvement, fixer des filtres, et changer la taille et l’apparence du pointeur à l’écran. Clavier virtuel : clavier affiché à l’écran qui peut être utilisé avec un écran tactile, une souris, une boule de commande (trackball), un joystick, ou autre dispositif de pointage. Outils de correction orthographique et grammaticale : fonctions du navigateur, modules d’extension (plugins) ou autres logiciels fournissant une assistance à l’écriture. Reconnaissance vocale (aussi appelée « commande vocale ») : logiciel qui reconnaît la voix humaine et peut servir à dicter du texte ou d’émettre des commandes pour interagir avec l’ordinateur. Écriture prédictive : logiciel qui propose une sélection de mots, d’expressions et de phrases basée sur la saisie en cours (et parfois en fonction du contexte) pour économiser de la frappe. Histoires liées à la saisie Alex, journaliste avec un trouble musculosquelettique Preety, élève de collège avec un trouble du déficit de l’attention avec hyperactivité et dyslexique Yun, retraité avec une mauvaise vue, un tremblement des mains, et une perte de mémoire à court terme Luis, assistant en supermarché, atteint du syndrome de Down Interaction : naviguer et trouver Les gens naviguent et trouvent du contenu suivant différentes stratégies et approches, selon leurs préférences, leurs compétences et leurs capacités. Par exemple, quelqu’un qui utilise un site web pour la première fois aura besoin d’une aide plus claire qu’une personne qui a plus d’expérience avec ce site en particulier, et quelqu’un qui utilise le Web sur un terminal mobile avec un petit écran peut avoir besoin de plus d’indices d’orientation qu’une personne sur un ordinateur de bureau. Ces situations, bien que davantage liées à l’utilisabilité avec ou sans handicap, affectent souvent plus sérieusement les personnes atteintes d’un handicap. Plus sur l’interaction Quelques exemples d’interaction liés au handicap : Une personne qui ne voit pas l’écran et a besoin d’avoir une compréhension générale, de s’orienter en cherchant les titres d’une page web ; les titres doivent aussi être conçus pour un tel besoin. Une personne qui ne voit qu’une petite partie de l’écran à la fois, qui utilise une loupe d’écran, et qui a besoin de s’orienter en s’appuyant sur des indices visuels ; le design visuel doit aussi permettre un tel usage. Une personne qui n’utilise que le clavier (ou une alternative au clavier) pour naviguer dans le contenu web ; la structure de la page doit être conçue pour permettre d’accéder efficacement à la page au clavier. Une personne qui a des difficultés à se rappeler les adresses, les noms, ou une fonctionnalité particulière sur un site web ; les navigateurs doivent fournir une aide qui simplifie l’usage et aide à se rappeler. Une personne qui peut avoir du mal à comprendre un menu hiérarchique, comme le sont de nombreux menus ; les sites doivent fournir des mécanismes de navigation alternatifs. De nombreuses fonctions dévolues à différents styles de navigation sont directement fournis par les navigateurs et les technologies d’assistance. Par exemple, la plupart des navigateurs courants fournissent des marque-pages, et les lecteurs d’écran permettent de lister les titres, les liens, et d’autres structures dans la page. Cependant, la conception du contenu est aussi un facteur essentiel afin de permettre différents styles de navigation. Exemples de techniques d’accessibilité Cohérence et prédictibilité : l’intitulé d’éléments tels que les liens, les boutons, et les contrôles doit être cohérent, et les actions attendues doivent pouvoir être prédites d’après le texte de l’élément. Titres et intitulés explicites : le titre de la page, les titres et intertitres, les intitulés des formulaires, des liens et des contrôles sont parfois lus hors de leur contexte et doivent être explicites. Messages d’erreur et de réussite clairs : les boîtes de dialogue et les autres messages, tels que ceux qui suivent la soumission d’un formulaire, doivent aider l’utilisateur à accomplir sa tâche et éviter la désorientation, la distraction, la confusion et l’inconfort. Mécanismes multiples de navigation : les sites web doivent fournir plusieurs moyens de localiser une page, par exemple en fournissant un plan du site et un moteur de recherche en complément des menus hiérarchiques de navigation. Liens d’évitement : mécanismes qui permettent à un utilisateur au clavier de sauter les blocs répétitifs de contenu tels que le haut de page, la barre de navigation ou le menu. Note : fournir trop de liens d’évitement est contre-productif. Indices d’orientation visuelle : par exemple, utiliser des couleurs de fond différentes pour différentes parties du contenu, utiliser des intitulés de titres uniques, placer l’information pertinente dans des zones importantes de la page. Exemples de technologies d’assistance et de stratégies d’adaptation Marque-pages et historique : utiliser les fonctions du navigateur pour se rappeler de pages, trouver des pages déjà visitées, ou aller rapidement à une page sans avoir besoin de taper une adresse web. Recherche par mot-clé : utiliser les fonctions du navigateur pour trouver du texte dans une page web, et une fonctionnalité du site pour trouver des pages via un mot-clé. Les moteurs de recherche qui sont mis en place et optimisés pour un site web particulier peuvent fournir des résultats de recherche plus précis. Navigation au clavier : parcourir le contenu en n’utilisant que le clavier, typiquement en utilisant la touche « Tabulation » pour sauter d’un élément structurel à l’autre, tel qu’un lien, un titre, un élément de liste, au suivant. La navigation au clavier dépend beaucoup du navigateur mais aussi de la conception de la page web elle-même, par exemple à l’aide de liens d’évitement. Carte de page : afficher une petite image qui représente la page entière, avec un indicateur pour montrer quelle partie de la page on est en train de consulter. Liens graphiques : certains navigateurs, plugins et sites web montrent des imagettes présentant la cible des liens (parfois appelées « screenshots » ou « saisies d’écran ») plutôt que leur adresse ou leur nom ; par exemple, en combinaison avec des listes de marque-pages et d’historique, des boutons de retour ou d’avance dans les navigateurs, ou des liens dans des pages web.

    "title": "Tools and Techniques",
    "text": "Summary This page introduces some of the techniques and tools that people with disabilities use to interact with the web — web browser settings, text-to-speech, voice recognition, and many more. Note: This page is illustrative and is not a complete list of all the ways that people interact with the web. Page Contents Tools and preferences Perception - hearing, feeling, and seeing Presentation distinguishing and understanding Input typing, writing, and clicking Interaction navigating and finding Tools and preferences People with disabilities access and navigate the Web in different ways, depending on their individual needs and preferences. Sometimes people configure standard software and hardware according to their needs, and sometimes people use specialized software and hardware that help them perform certain tasks. More about tools and preferences Some common approaches for interacting with the Web include: Assistive Technologies – software and hardware that people with disabilities use to improve interaction with the web. These include screen readers that read aloud web pages for people who cannot read the text, screen magnifiers for people with some types of low vision, and voice recognition software and selection switches for people who cannot use a keyboard or mouse. Adaptive Strategies – techniques that people with disabilities use to improve interaction with the Web, such as increasing text size, reducing mouse speed, and turning on captions. Adaptive strategies include techniques with standard software, with mainstream web browsers, and with assistive technologies. Accessibility benefits people with and without disabilities. Features that support accessibility are becoming increasingly available in standard computer hardware, mobile devices, operating systems, web browsers, and other tools. Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your Computer provides information about customizing your computer to take advantage of such accessibility features and solutions. Sometimes hardware and software with specific accessibility features, including web browsers, media players, or assistive technologies, may not be available to an individual. For example, tools may not be affordable, not installed or not compatible with the computer, not available in some languages, or not available for other reasons. In other cases, people are unaware of accessibility solutions or how to configure and use them. Perception - hearing, feeling, and seeing People perceive content through different senses depending on their needs and preferences. For example, some people are not seeing the screen or hearing the audio. Examples of perception include: Auditory - such as speech, music, and sound that can be heard. Tactile - such as dots, bars, and vibration that can be felt. Visual - such as images, text, and video that can be seen. More about perception Some people need to convert content from one form to another to perceive it. For example, someone who is deaf-blind requires audio and visual content in a tactile form (such as Braille). Other people need to perceive content through multiple senses, such as someone with dyslexia who may need to hear and see the text to understand it better. Content in textual form can be more easily converted into other forms and is therefore particularly useful. However, text-only content poses barriers for many people who have difficulty with written language. Graphics and illustrations can be made accessible and often improve understandability, ease-of-use, and satisfaction with websites and applications for everyone. In some cases, content can be converted into different forms using software or hardware. For example, a text-to-speech software can convert text into speech. In other cases, content authors need to provide alternative forms of the content. For example, at least some level of human intervention is necessary to create textual descriptions for images and captions for audio content. Sometimes software tools, such as voice and picture recognition, can assist authors in providing such alternatives but the conversion is usually not fully automatable. Examples of accessibility features Audio descriptions – (also referred to as “video descriptions” and “described video”) narrations that describe important visual details in a video. These narrations can be during natural pauses in the audio, or in separate audio files or audio tracks in multimedia. Auditory, tactile, and visual notifications - prompting or alerting the user in different ways such as by blinking or displaying visual dialogs, by using sound, or by vibration. Braille – a system using six to eight raised dots in various patterns, to represent letters and numbers. These characters are read by scanning over the raised dots using the fingertips. Braille is used by people who are blind but not all individuals who are blind know braille. Captions – text with a verbatim recording of any speech and with descriptions of relevant auditory information that appears simultaneously with the audio (including audio that accompanies video in multimedia). For real-time captioning typically professional CART writers are necessary. Text-to-speech (sometimes called “speech synthesis” or “speech output”) - automatic conversion of text into a synthesized voice reading the text aloud. Transcripts – text manuscripts containing the correct sequence of verbatim recording of any speech, and descriptions of important auditory or visual information. Examples of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies Refreshable Braille display – a mechanical terminal that displays a line of Braille characters (usually 40-80) by raising and lowering the dots (pins) dynamically. Braille devices with capabilities of small computers incorporate Braille displays. These devices can be used to take notes, calculate numbers, or to interface with other devices such as public information kiosks. Screen reader – software that processes content on the desktop and in web browsers, and converts it to others forms such as text-to-speech and Braille. Screen readers typically provide other functions such as shortcut keys, different modes for processing content and interacting with it, and the ability to highlight the text that is being read aloud. Voice browser – similar to screen reader but usually only processes web content. Voice browsers are typically not developed as assistive tools but as alternative web browsers for mobile devices or similar. Stories related to perception Martine, online student who is hard of hearing Ilya, senior staff member who is blind Preety, middle school student with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Dyslexia Kaseem, teenager who is deaf and blind Presentation distinguishing and understanding People adjust the presentation of content to make it easier to distinguish and understand. These adjustments include: Making audio content easier to hear and visual content easier to see; Combining audio and visual content to make information easier to understand; Providing alternative presentations of the content, such as sign-language. More about presentation Some people need larger text and image sizes or higher contrast between text and background colors to see the content better, and some people need louder audio with lower background noise to better hear the content. Some people need to turn off pop-up windows and animations that disorient or distract them. A sound that is automatically played, such as background music on a website, can also distract people or interfere with text-to-speech software. Web content, browsers, and tools need to support adjusting the presentation according to peoples’ needs and preferences. Making text more readable is of particular importance. This involves changing its visual appearance, using additional text-to-speech, and adapting the content. For example, changing the font type, colors, spacing, and line width makes texts more readable for many people. Sometimes text-to-speech is used to assist reading further. Adapting the content involves rearranging sections of web pages, adding functionality such as dictionaries and glossaries, and hiding less used functionality. While these changes are often managed using specialized web browsers and tools, website authors need to provide adequate coding to support such adjustments and adaptations. Also, people process information differently. This aspect is particularly relevant for learning environments but also applies to many other situations. In some cases, authors can provide different representations of the same information to address the widest audience possible, such as graphical and tabular representations of data for people with different learning styles, or sign language videos for sign language users. Examples of accessibility features Customized fonts and colors – changing the font types, sizes, colors, and spacing to make text easier to read. Customization involves browser settings and, for more advanced users, cascading style sheets (CSS) to override the default appearance of web content. Document outline – representation of the content that only shows the headings and relevant structures (such as headings nesting and hierarchy) to help provide orientation and an overview of the contents. Easy-to-read text – simplified summaries for passages of text to help make it easier to understand. Progressive disclosure – design technique that involves showing only the least amount of information or functions necessary for a given task or purpose, to avoid overloading the user with information. Reduced interface – representation of the content that only shows most relevant information or more frequently used functions; for example, by hiding other parts of the content that can distract users. Screen magnification – changing the settings of the web browser, operating system, or screen to enlarge or reduce text size and images. Some people use magnification lenses, binoculars, or other visual aids, and software such as screen magnifiers to better see the content. Sign language – a visual form of communication that is primarily used by people who are deaf. It involves hand, body, and facial expressions to transmit words, phrase, and tone. For instance, the intensity of a gesture could indicate the mood or emphasis of particular information. As in written languages, there are many sign languages and dialects, some of which are recognized as official languages in some countries. Not all people who have auditory disabilities or who are deaf know sign language. Symbols – icons that represent words or concepts used instead of text by some people with impaired communication, including people with difficulties to read or write. Examples of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies Pop-up and animations blockers – web browser plug-ins or other software tools that stop automatic pop-up windows and redirection, and options to stop, pause, and hide animations. Reading assistants – software that changes the presentation of content and provides other functionality to make it more readable. Examples include: Customizing the font type, size, spacing, or foreground and background colors; Scanning the text for complex words and phrases, and linking them to glossaries; Hiding less relevant parts of the content, such as sidebars and header areas; Providing outlines of the page headings and summaries of the text passages; Reading the content aloud and highlight the text as it is being read out loud. Screen magnifier – software used primarily by people with partial sight to enlarge the content to make it easier to see. Some screen magnifiers provide text-to-speech and other functionality. Volume control – options to adjust the volume of audio content being played, including options to turn off the sound altogether, that are separate from the overall system settings. Stories related to presentation Lee, online shopper with color blindness Martine, online student who is hard of hearing Preety, middle school student with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Dyslexia Yun, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss Luis, supermarket assistant with Down syndrome Kaseem, teenager who is deaf and blind Input typing, writing, and clicking People use different approaches to enter text and activate commands. For instance, some people do not use a mouse, keyboard, or both, while others use specific configurations for keyboard and mouse, or use alternative hardware and software altogether. Examples of input include using: Keyboard only by people with cognitive, physical, and visual disabilities; Touch screen only by people with cognitive and physical disabilities; Mouse and keyboard with software that compensates for hand tremor; Voice recognition (speech input) and other hands-free interaction. More about input Some people use software and customized settings to enhance the efficiency of typing, writing, and clicking. For example, some people assign personalized shortcut keys to functions they frequently use. Some people use word prediction software to help complete words and sentences with minimal typing, grammar and spelling tools to help correct text, and tools to help click, select text, and scroll with minimal movement. Web content needs to be designed to support these different types of approaches. For example, forms, links, and other functionality need to be usable by keyboard. In particular, web applications (“client-side scripting”), embedded media players, and other programmatic objects need to provide full keyboard support that does not trap the keyboard focus within the program and larger clickable areas for buttons and links. Accessible web content supports people who need more time typing, writing, and clicking, or are more likely to make mistakes. For instance, some people forget to select options and fill out form entries, misspell words and mistype data (such as dates), or unintentionally activate buttons and links. Accessible web content also provides enough time to complete tasks, clear and helpful error messages and options for correcting input. Examples of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies Accelerators – software and functionality that help reduce the effort needed to type or click. For example, by providing options to create shortcuts for commands or sequences of commands, by highlighting selection choices such as menu items, links, or options, and by helping to steer the mouse. Alternative keyboard and mouse – hardware and software primarily used by people with cognitive and physical disabilities to help interact with the computer. Examples include: Keyboards with larger keys, key labels, key spacing, illuminated keys, or custom layouts; On-screen keyboards, touch-screens, sip-and-puff switches, and single-key switches; Trackballs, joysticks, touchpads, specially designed mice, and other pointing devices; Voice recognition, eye tracking, and other approaches for hands-free interaction. Eye tracking (sometimes called “eye-gaze”) - a system that monitors eye movement to control the mouse pointer and detects blinking to initiate mouse clicks. Keyboard customization – includes changing the mapping of keys, assigning shortcut keys to functions, setting filters, and setting “sticky keys” to support single-handed typing. Keyboard and mouse filters – functions of the operating system or software tools that recognize and compensate for involuntary movements such as tremor and spasms. Mouse customization – includes changing the mapping of buttons, changing the sensitivity of the mouse towards movement, setting filters, and changing the size and appearance of the mouse pointer. On-screen keyboard – virtual keyboard displayed on a screen so that it can be used with a touchscreen, mouse, trackball, joystick, or other pointing devices. Spelling and grammar tools – web browser functions, plug-ins, or other software tools to help users write. Voice recognition (sometimes called “speech input” or “voice command”) - software that recognizes the human voice and can be used to dictate text or to issue commands to operate the computer. Word prediction – software that presents selections of matching words, phrases, or sentences based on the current input (and sometimes context) to save typing. Stories related to input Alex, reporter with repetitive stress injury Preety, middle school student with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Dyslexia Yun, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss Luis, supermarket assistant with Down syndrome Interaction navigating and finding People navigate and find content using different strategies and approaches depending on their preferences, skills, and abilities. For instance, someone using a website for the first time may need clearer guidance than someone who has more experience with the particular site, and someone using the Web on a mobile device with a small screen may require more orientational cues than someone using a desktop computer. While these are typically usability aspects that affect people with and without disabilities, some situations affect people with disabilities to a greater extent. More about interaction Examples of such situations include: A person is not seeing the screen and needing to get an overview and orient themselves by scanning the headings on a web page; the headings need to be also designed to support such purposes. A person who is only seeing small portions of the screen at a time due to screen magnification, and need to orient themselves using visual cues; the visual design needs to also support such purposes. A person using only the keyboard (or keyboard alternatives) to navigate through the web content; the structure of web pages need to be designed to also support and efficient use of the keyboard. A person who has difficulty remembering the addresses, names, or particular functionality of websites; web browsers need to provide supporting functionality that is easy to use and remember. A person who may have difficulty with hierarchical menu navigation, as how most navigation menus are designed to be; websites need to provide alternative mechanisms for navigation. Many functions to support different styles of navigation are built directly into web browsers and assistive technologies. For example, most commonly available browsers provide bookmark functionality, and screen readers provide functions to list headings, links, and other structures on a web page. However, the design of the content is also an essential factor to support different styles of navigation. Examples of accessibility features Consistency and predictability – labeling of functions such as links, buttons, and controls should be consistent, and the expected function should be predictable from the label. Descriptive titles, headings, and labels – page titles, section headings, and labels for forms, links, and controls are sometimes read on their own or out of context and need to be descriptive. Helpful error and success messages – dialogs and other messages, such as after submitting forms, need to help users complete their tasks and avoid disorientation, distraction, confusion, or discomfort. Multiple navigation mechanisms – websites need to provide multiple ways to locate web pages, for example by providing sitemaps and search functionality in addition to hierarchical navigation menus. Skip links – mechanisms to allow keyboard users to skip over repetitive blocks of content such as page headings, navigation bars, or menus. Note: too many skip links are counterproductive to this purpose. Visual orientation cues – examples include using background colors to indicate different parts of the content, using unique headings, and placing relevant information in prominent areas of a web page. Examples of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies Bookmarks and history – using web browser functions to help remember pages, find previously visited pages, or quickly go to pages without needing to type a web address. Keyword search – using web browser functions to find text within a web page, and website functionality to search for web pages by keyword. Search engines that are maintained and optimized for a particular website can provide more precise search results. Keyboard navigation – moving through the content using the keyboard, typically by using the tab key to jump from one structural item such as link, header, or list item, to the next. Keyboard navigation largely depends on web browser support but also on website design features such as skip links. Page maps – displaying a small image of the entire web page with an indicator highlighting the portion within the web page that is being currently viewed. Pictorial links – some web browsers, plug-ins, and websites show small images of the link targets (sometimes called “screen shots”) rather than the addresses or names; for example in combination with bookmarks and history listings, back and forward buttons in web browsers, or links on web pages.

    "text": "Resumen Las siguientes historias de personas con discapacidad usando la web resaltan el efecto de las barreras de accesibilidad y los grandes beneficios de los sitios web y herramientas accesibles. Nota: Los siguientes escenarios no incluyen a personas reales. Contenidos de la página Lee, comprador en línea con daltonismo Alex, periodista con trastorno musculoesquelético Martine, estudiante en línea con hipoacusia Ilya, empleada antigua con ceguera Preety, estudiante de secundaria con trastorno por déficit de atención e hiperactividad y dislexia Yun, jubilado con baja visión, temblor de manos y pérdida de memoria a corto plazo leve Luis, ayudante de supermercado con síndrome de Down Kaseem, adolescente sordociega Lee, comprador en línea con daltonismo Lee tiene daltonismo y encuentra barreras cuando compra en línea. Tiene una de las discapacidades visuales más comunes entre los hombres: daltonismo rojo-verde. Lee compra en línea con frecuencia y a veces encuentra problemas en aquellos sitios web o aplicaciones donde el contraste de color del texto y de las imágenes no es adecuado, así como en aquellos sitios donde el color se utiliza para marcar los campos requeridos o los precios de venta. Cuando se usan combinaciones de rojo y verde, Lee no puede distinguir entre ellas, pues ambos colores los ve como si fueran marrón. También se le hace difícil elegir productos cuando las muestras de color no están etiquetadas con un nombre. Las experiencias de Lee son mejores con el contenido y las aplicaciones que hacen un uso adecuado del contraste y le permiten ajustar el contraste desde el navegador. Puede reconocer qué información es requerida si se emplean asteriscos. Puede identificar más fácilmente los productos que quiere comprar, especialmente la ropa, cuando los nombres de los colores se ofrecen en una selección de opciones en lugar de muestras de color solamente. Vea los siguientes recursos donde encontrará más información para implementar técnicas que eliminan las barreras que encuentra Lee: Secciones relacionadas con Lee Habilidades y barreras diversas: Daltonismo (discapacidades visuales) (en Inglés) Herramientas y técnicas: Fuentes y colores personalizados (presentación) Principios de accesibilidad: El contenido se puede presentar de diferentes formas (Perceptible) El contenido es más fácil de ver y oír (Perceptible) El contenido es compatible con herramientas actuales y futuras (Robusto) Alex, periodista con trastorno musculoesquelético Alex ha trabajado como periodista durante más de 20 años y ha desarrollado un trastorno musculoesquelético por el que le resulta doloroso usar el ratón y teclear durante largos periodos de tiempo. A pesar de que necesitó investigación, tiempo y voluntad para aprender, es capaz de trabajar con menos dolores gracias a las siguientes modificaciones en su entorno de trabajo: uso de un teclado ergonómico uso de instrucciones de teclado sin ratón programa de reconocimiento de voz en su ordenador y en su móvil asistencia táctil en su móvil Alex encuentra problemas cuando los sitios web y el contenido en línea no se puede navegar usando únicamente instrucciones del teclado. Con frecuencia encuentra formularios web que no tienen equivalencia con el teclado. A veces es también difícil saltar cierto contenido y navegar a secciones en una página web sin usar muchas instrucciones del teclado, lo cual es agotador y limita el tiempo que puede pasar trabajando cómodamente. Recientemente ha empezado a explorar el uso de la asistencia al toque en su teléfono móvil, que le ayuda a hacer menos gestos y trabajar durante periodos de tiempo más largos. Como ajuste temporal, la empresa de Alex ha habilitado atajos personalizados que proporcionan soporte para el teclado para que pueda usar el sistema de gestión de contenidos interno, con la intención de implementar un soporte para el teclado mejorado y beneficiar a todos los usuarios en la próxima versión del programa. Vea los siguientes recursos donde encontrará más información para implementar técnicas que eliminan las barreras que encuentra Alex: Secciones relacionadas con Alex Habilidades y barreras diversas: Trastorno musculoesquelético (discapacidades físicas) (en Inglés) Herramientas y técnicas: Aceleradores (entrada) (en Inglés) Teclado y ratón alternativos (entrada) (en Inglés) Reconocimiento de voz (entrada) (en Inglés) Predicción de voz (entrada) (en Inglés) Navegación con teclado (interacción) (en Inglés) Enlaces de salto (interacción) (en Inglés) Principios de accesibilidad: Alternativas textuales para contenido no textual (Perceptible) El contenido se puede presentar de diferentes formas (Perceptible) Funcionalidad disponible desde el teclado (Operable) Los usuarios tienen suficiente tiempo para leer y usar el contenido (Operable) Los usuarios pueden navegar fácilmente, encontrar contenido y determinar dónde se encuentran (Operable) El contenido se muestra y se opera de forma predecible (Comprensible) Los usuarios reciben ayuda para evitar y corregir errores (Comprensible) El contenido es compatible con herramientas presentes y futuras (Robusto) Martine, estudiante en línea con hipoacusia Martine tiene 62 años y padece pérdida auditiva desde que nació. Puede oír algunos sonidos, pero no lo suficiente para entender el habla. En su infancia aprendió la lengua de signos y durante sus primeros años en el colegio aprendió a escribir. Ahora vuelve a ser estudiante en cursos universitarios en línea. Su universidad proporciona intérpretes de lengua de signos y estenotipia para ofrecer textos escritos que reflejan fielmente la comunicación hablada en sus cursos. Sin embargo, Martine ha encontrado barreras cuando los vídeos y otros medios no se subtitulan. La universidad se dio cuenta de la necesidad de proporcionar subtítulos y transcripciones para los materiales de audio y está trabajando con un proveedor de servicios para subtitular todo el contenido publicado en los sitios web de la universidad. incluyendo todo el contenido de los cursos incluidos el sistema de gestión de aprendizaje. Además de dar acceso al contenido a los estudiantes sordos y con pérdida auditiva, la universidad ha encontrado que los subtítulos y las transcripciones tienen beneficios adicionales. Las transcripciones facilitan la creación de subtítulos en varios idiomas y también mejoran el indexado del contenido en línea. La mejora del indexado también mejora la optimización en los motores de búsqueda y la posibilidad de encontrar el contenido en línea de la universidad. La universidad sigue las pautas WCAG para proporcionar subtítulos. Vea los siguientes recursos donde encontrará más información para implementar técnicas que eliminan las barreras que encuentra Martine: Secciones relacionadas con Martine Habilidades y barreras diversas: Hipoacusia (discapacidades auditivas) (en Inglés) Herramientas y técnicas: Subtítulos (percepción) (en Inglés) Transcripciones (percepción) (en Inglés) Lengua de signos (percepción) (en Inglés) Principios de accesibilidad: Alternativas textuales para contenido no textual (Perceptible) Subtítulos y otras alternativas para multimedia (Perceptible) El contenido es más fácil de ver y oír (Perceptible) El contenido es legible y comprensible (Comprensible) Ilya, empleada antigua con ceguera Ilya es ciega. Es la jefa de contabilidad en una empresa de seguros que utiliza documentos web y formularios en la intranet corporativa y, al igual que otras personas ciegas que usan ordenadores, no lee braille. Ilya utiliza un lector de pantalla y un teléfono móvil para acceder a la web. Las características accesibles de su lector de pantalla y su teléfono móvil le ofrecen información hablada sobre el sistema operativo, las aplicaciones y el contenido textual. Cuando accede al contenido web, el lector de pantalla lee en voz alta la información estructural del documento, como por ejemplo los encabezados, las columnas y filas de una tabla, elementos de una lista, enlaces, controles de formulario y demás, lo cual le permite navegar por la página, rellenar y enviar formularios y acceder a al información de una forma efectiva. Puede escuchar y entender la salida de voz a una velocidad muy alta. Ilya encuentra problemas cuando los sitios web no están codificados correctamente y no incluyen texto alternativo para describir las imágenes. Estos sitios no se pueden navegar y requieren mucho tiempo para leer el texto completo, de principio a fin, sin pistas para navegar. A veces se encuentra atrapada en partes de un sitio web y no se puede mover a otra zona, por lo que termina abandonando la página. Como es una empleada con experiencia en su empresa, Ilya proporciona formación a otros empleados en entornos en línea, a través de aplicaciones de conferencia, compartido de documentos y diapositivas y salas de chat. Ilya y su equipo han evaluado varias herramientas de aprendizaje antes de dar con una aplicación que tuviera las características de accesibilidad que necesita un equipo diverso con diferentes capacidades. Vea los siguientes recursos donde encontrará más información para implementar técnicas que eliminan las barreras que encuentra Ilya: Secciones relacionadas con Ilya Habilidades y barreras diversas: Ceguera (discapacidades visuales) (en Inglés) Herramientas y técnicas: Lector de pantallas (percepción) (en Inglés) Texto a voz (percepción) (en Inglés) Transcripciones (percepción) (en Inglés) Consistencia y predicción (interacción) (en Inglés) Títulos, encabezados y etiquetas descriptivos (interacción) (en Inglés) Mensajes de error y de éxito útiles (interacción) (en Inglés) Navegación con teclado (interacción) (en Inglés) Enlaces de salto (interacción) (en Inglés) Principios de accesibilidad: Alternativas textuales para contenido no textual (Perceptible) Subtítulos y otras alternativas para multimedia (Perceptible) El contenido se puede presentar de diferentes formas (Perceptible) El contenido es más fácil de ver y de oír (Perceptible) Funcionalidad disponible desde el teclado (Operable) Los usuarios pueden navegar fácilmente, encontrar contenido y determinar dónde se encuentran (Operable) El contenido es legible y comprensible (Comprensible) El contenido se muestra y se opera de forma predecible (Comprensible) El contenido es compatible con herramientas presentes y futuras (Robusto) Preety, estudiante de secundaria con trastorno por déficit de atención e hiperactividad y dislexia Preety es una estudiante de secundaria con trastorno por déficit de atención e hiperactividad y dislexia. Aunque tiene dificultades considerables para leer, disfruta particularmente en las clases de literatura. En la escuela de Preety se han empezado a usar libros electrónicos recientemente. Al principio, Preety estaba preocupada por el nuevo formato, pero gracias a los programas de texto a voz que resaltan el texto en la pantalla mientras lo leen en voz alta, se ha dado cuenta de que puede concentrarse en el contenido más fácilmente en lugar de tener que pelear con cada palabra. El programa de texto a voz también sirve de ayuda con otros textos en línea, pero la experiencia de Preety con los sitios web varía mucho de un sitio a otro. Algunos sitios usan gráficos e ilustraciones de forma que le ayudan a concentrarse en las secciones y en el contenido que le gustaría leer, mientras que otros sitios tienen muchos anuncios y contenido que se mueve que provocan distracciones. También encuentra problemas con el contenido en línea cuando la navegación no es muy evidente. Le parece que son más fáciles de usar los sitios web y aplicaciones que proporcionan diferentes formas de navegar, como por ejemplo barra de navegación, herramienta de búsqueda, migas de pan y un mapa del sitio. La escuela de Preety también está usando un nuevo catálogo de la biblioteca en línea con mejoras de accesibilidad. Antes de que se implementara el nuevo catálogo, Preety tenía que visitar la biblioteca físicamente para obtener ayuda en la búsqueda de materiales. Ahora puede buscar en el catálogo de forma independiente usando su teléfono móvil, tableta o portátil. Preety todavía tiene problemas para deletrear palabras, pero la funcionalidad de la herramienta de búsqueda que sugiere palabras alternativas y corrige errores es muy útil para ella y mejora enormemente su experiencia. Vea los siguientes recursos donde encontrará más información para implementar técnicas que eliminan las barreras que encuentra Preety: Secciones relacionadas con Preety Habilidades y barreras diversas: Trastorno por déficit de atención e hiperactividad, TDAH (discapacidades cognitivas) (en Inglés) Dislexia (discapacidades cognitivas) (en Inglés) Herramientas y técnicas: Subtítulos (percepción) (en Inglés) Lector de pantalla (percepción) (en Inglés) Texto a voz (percepción) (en Inglés) Bloqueadores de pop-up y animaciones (presentación) (en Inglés) Ayuda para la lectura (presentación) (en Inglés) Herramientas de corrección sintáctica y gramática (entrada) (en Inglés) Consistencia y predicción (interacción) (en Inglés) Mensajes de error y de éxito útiles (interacción) (en Inglés) Búsqueda por palabras clave (interacción) (en Inglés) Mecanismos de navegación múltiple (interacción) (en Inglés) Principios de accesibilidad: Alternativas textuales para contenido no textual (Perceptible) El contenido se puede presentar de diferentes formas (Perceptible) Los usuarios tienen suficiente tiempo para leer y usar el contenido (Operable) Los usuarios pueden navegar fácilmente, encontrar contenido y determinar dónde se encuentran (Operable) El contenido es legible y comprensible (Comprensible) El contenido se muestra y se opera de forma predecible (Comprensible) Los usuarios reciben ayuda para evitar y corregir errores (Comprensible) El contenido es compatible con herramientas presentes y futuras (Robusto) Yun, jubilado con baja visión, temblor de manos y pérdida de memoria a corto plazo leve Yun tiene 85 años y padece de baja visión, temblor de manos y pérdida de memoria leve; son discapacidades comunes para alguien de su edad. Yun utiliza la web habitualmente para leer noticias. En los últimos años también ha empezado a usar redes sociales para estar en contacto con familiares y amigos. Tiene su propio blog donde publica artículos de historia del arte y otros temas que le interesan. Como muchas otras personas, Yun tiene problemas para leer textos pequeños y clicar en enlaces o elementos de formulario pequeños. Su hija le ha enseñado cómo agrandar el texto en el navegador, lo cual funciona bien en muchos sitios web. Encuentra problemas cuando el texto no se adapta al ser agrandado y se ve obligado a desplazarse hacia adelante y hacia atrás para leer el texto grande, lo cual quiere decir que a menudo pierde la posición donde se encontraba. También tiene problemas con las imágenes CAPTCHA que se encuentran en muchos sitios de redes sociales. El texto está tan distorsionado que, incluso cuando lo agranda, no puede introducir el texto de forma correcta. Su experiencia es mejor con esos sitios que usan opciones alternativas a los CAPTCHA, pero por desgracia solamente una minoría lo hace. La hija de Yun le regaló un ratón especial que le resulta más fácil de usar con su temblor de manos. También utiliza un navegador que guarda imágenes en miniatura de los sitios web que visita con frecuencia, de esta forma es más fácil para el identificar los sitios a los que más acude.

Trabaja en un supermercado, embolsando la compra de los clientes. Normalmente hace su compra en el mismo supermercado donde trabaja, pero a veces se siente desorientado por la gran cantidad de opciones de productos y tiene problemas para encontrar sus cosas favoritas cuando cambian la distribución de la tienda. Hace poco, un amigo suyo le enseñó una aplicación para hacer la compra en línea que cuenta con una navegación consistente y fácil de usar, con instrucciones claras y directas. Así Luis puede añadir la lista de las cosas que compra con más frecuencia y guardarla en la aplicación para usos futuros. También le gusta la herramienta de búsqueda que hace sugerencias cuando se equivoca al escribir las palabras. La aplicación también calcula el precio total de las cosas en su carrito de la compra virtual, lo cual le ayuda a controlar cuánto está gastando. Su amigo también le enseñó algunas características de accesibilidad de su móvil que le parecen muy útiles, como la predicción de palabras, que ofrece una selección de posibles palabras según los caracteres introducidos. y la funcionalidad de texto a voz, que le permite escuchar las reseñas que han dejado otros usuarios de la aplicación. Con la ayuda de estas herramientas, Luis ha empezado a publicar sus propias reseñas de productos que ha comprado. Ahora Luis usa la aplicación para hacer la compra habitual en línea un par de veces al mes y en ocasiones compra productos nuevos en el supermercado donde trabaja.

Kaseem usa: Un programa de magnificación de pantalla para agrandar el texto de los sitios web hasta un tamaño conveniente; Un lector de pantalla que presenta el texto en un dispositivo de lectura de braille; Una pantalla de ordenador grande de alta resolución y alta luminosidad (brillo). El anotador de braille electrónico y portátil de Kassem viene con calendario, correo electrónico, navegación web y funcionalidad para tomar notas. Su dispositivo móvil incluye GPS, lo cual le ayuda a orientarse y moverse en la ciudad. Kaseem usa el sitio web del transporte público para organizar sus viajes y comprobar los horarios de autobús, pero tiene problemas cuando agranda el texto y éste no se adapta adecuadamente, haciendo que los mapas sean muy difíciles de usar. Su experiencia es mejor con los horarios de los trenes porque están adecuadamente codificados y el texto se adapta. Kaseem encontró los datos para contactar con los responsables de la web de transporte público y les envió un mensaje para informarles sobre los problemas que encontró en su sitio. También les envió un enlace al sitio web de ferrocarriles y explicó por qué ese sitio funciona mejor para ella. Recibió un mensaje de agradecimiento por la información facilitada y le hicieron saber que el equipo responsable de la web de transporte público planea implementar mejoras de accesibilidad en el lanzamiento de su nuevo sitio web.

    "text": "Résumé Les histoires qui suivent mettent en lumière les effets de points d’accessibilité bloquants sur des utilisateurs du Web handicapés, ainsi que les bénéfices plus larges de sites et de services web accessibles. Note : les scénarios ci-dessous ne représentent pas de vraies personnes. Ils ne recouvrent pas toutes les situations de handicaps. Contenus de cette page Lee, client de site Web marchand, daltonien Alex, journaliste avec un trouble musculosquelettique Martine, étudiante en ligne, malentendante Ilya, cadre supérieure, aveugle Preety, élève de collège avec un trouble du déficit de l’attention avec hyperactivité et dyslexique Yun, retraité avec une mauvaise vue, un tremblement des mains, et une perte de mémoire à court terme Luis, assistant en supermarché, atteint du syndrome de Down Kaseem, adolescente qui est sourde et aveugle Lee, client de site Web marchand, daltonien Lee est daltonien et est confronté à de nombreuses barrières quand il fait ses achats en ligne. Il a l’un des handicaps visuels les plus courants chez les hommes : il confond le rouge et le vert. Lee achète souvent en ligne et rencontre souvent des problèmes avec des sites web ou des applications où le contraste de couleur du texte et des images n’est pas adéquat, et où la couleur seule est utilisée pour indiquer les champs obligatoires et les tarifs promotionnels. Quand des combinaisons de rouge et de vert sont utilisées, Lee ne peut pas faire la différence entre les deux, qu’il perçoit avec une apparence brune dans les deux cas. Il lui est aussi très difficile de faire des choix de produits quand les palettes de couleurs ne portent pas d’étiquettes donnant le nom de la couleur. Lee a une meilleure expérience des contenus en ligne et des applications qui utilisent des contrastes adéquats et qui lui permettent d’ajuster les réglages de contrastes dans son navigateur. Il est aussi mieux en mesure de reconnaître quand une information qu’il doit fournir est obligatoire si des astérisques sont présentes. Lee peut identifier facilement les produits qu’il veut acheter, en particulier les vêtements, quand l’intitulé de la couleur est inclus dans les options de sélection plutôt qu’une palette de couleurs sans texte.

Après un effort considérable de recherche qui lui a demandé beaucoup de temps et de volonté d’apprendre, il peut maintenant limiter la douleur en appliquant les modifications suivantes à son environnement de travail : utilisation d’un clavier ergonomique utilisation de commandes au clavier sans passer par la souris logiciel de reconnaissance vocale sur son ordinateur et son téléphone mobile utilisation de l’assistance tactile de son téléphone mobile Alex rencontre des problèmes quand des sites web et d’autres contenus en ligne ne peuvent pas être utilisés uniquement au clavier. Il est fréquemment confronté à des formulaires web qui n’ont pas d’équivalent au clavier. Parfois il lui est aussi difficile de sauter des contenus et d’atteindre des sections d’une page sans avoir recours à plusieurs commandes au clavier, ce qui est très fatigant et qui réduit la durée pendant laquelle il peut travailler confortablement. Dernièrement il a commencé à explorer l’assistance tactile sur son téléphone, qui l’aide là aussi à faire moins de gestes et à augmenter son temps de travail. L’employeur d’Alex a, à titre temporaire, créé plusieurs raccourcis sur mesure pour lui permettre d’utiliser au clavier le système de publication interne de l’entreprise ; il prévoit de fournir un support complet du clavier pour tous les utilisateurs dans la prochaine version du logiciel. Pour plus d’informations sur les techniques qui permettent d’enlever des points bloquants pour Alex, référez-vous aux ressources suivantes : Sections liées à Alex Capacités diverses et points bloquants Trouble musculosquelettique (Handicaps physiques) Outils et techniques Accélérateurs (Saisie) Clavier et souris alternatifs (Saisie) Reconnaissance vocale (Saisie) Écriture prédictive (Saisie) Navigation au clavier (Interaction) Liens d’évitement (Interaction) Principes d’accessibilité Text alternatives for non-text content (Perceivable) Content can be presented in different ways (Perceivable) Functionality is available from a keyboard (Operable) Users have enough time to read and use the content (Operable) Users can easily navigate, find content, and determine where they are (Operable) Content appears and operates in predictable ways (Understandable) Users are helped to avoid and correct mistakes (Understandable) Content is compatible with current and future user tools (Robust) Martine, étudiante en ligne, malentendante Martine a 62 ans et est malentendante depuis la naissance. Elle peut entendre quelques sons, mais pas assez pour comprendre la parole. Dans l’enfance elle a appris la langue des signes, et pendant ses premières années d’école elle a appris la langue écrite. Elle est étudiante à nouveau : elle suit des cours universitaires en ligne. L’université à laquelle elle est inscrite propose des interprètes en langue des signes et de la sténotypie en temps réel (Communication Access Realtime Translation) qui fournit des verbatims écrits reprenant ce qui est dit dans ses cours. Cependant Martine rencontre des points bloquants quand les vidéos ou d’autres contenus média ne sont pas sous-titrés. L’université est maintenant consciente des besoins et des obligations de fournir des médias sous-titrés et des transcriptions pour les contenus audio ; elle travaille avec un fournisseur de sous-titres afin de sous-titrer tous les contenus publiés sur les sites de l’université, y compris le contenu de tous les cours fournis sur les plate-formes en ligne. En plus de donner un accès aux contenus pour les étudiants sourds et malentendants, l’université a découvert que les sous-titres et les transcriptions ont d’autres bénéfices. Les transcriptions facilitent la production de sous-titres dans plusieurs langues et aident aussi à mieux indexer les contenus en ligne. Une meilleure indexation permet une meilleure optimisation pour les moteurs de recherche et rend les contenus de l’université plus facilement trouvables. L’université suit les recommandations des WCAG (Recommandations d’Accessibilité des Contenus Web) pour fournir les sous-titres.

Elle est directrice de la comptabilité dans une compagnie d’assurance qui utilise des documents et des formulaires web sur l’intranet de l’entreprise et, comme de nombreux utilisateurs aveugles d’ordinateurs, elle ne lit pas le braille. Ilya utilise un lecteur d’écran et un téléphone mobile pour accéder au Web. Son lecteur d’écran et les services d’accessibilité de son téléphone lui fournissent des informations sur le système, les applications, et les contenus textes dans une forme vocalisée. Quand elle accède à des contenus web, le lecteur d’écran lui indique à voix haute les informations structurelles d’une page web comme les titres et intertitres, les en-têtes de lignes et de colonnes, les éléments de listes, les liens, les éléments de formulaires, et plus encore, qui lui permettent de mieux naviguer dans la page, de compléter et d’envoyer des formulaires, d’accéder à l’information d’une façon efficace. Elle est capable d’écouter et de comprendre une sortie audio à très grande vitesse. Ilya rencontre des problèmes quand les sites web ne sont pas codés correctement et n’incluent pas de textes alternatifs sur les images. Ces sites ne sont pas navigables et demandent beaucoup de temps pour lire tout le texte du haut en bas de la page sans indications de navigation. De temps en temps elle se retrouve coincée dans une partie d’une page web et est incapable d’en sortir pour aller consulter une autre partie ; elle doit abandonner la page définitivement. En tant que senior dans son organisation, Ilya forme les employés à travers des outils en ligne, des applications de webinaires, de partage de documents et de présentations, ainsi que des outils de chat. Ilya et son équipe ont testé plusieurs outils avant de trouver une application efficace qui fournit une accessibilité suffisante pour une équipe diverse avec des capacités diverses.

Bien qu’elle ait des difficultés marquées pour lire, elle aime particulièrement sa classe de littérature. Le collège de Preety a commencé récemment à utiliser des cartables numériques. Preety était d’abord inquiète à l’idée d’utiliser ce nouveau format, mais avec le logiciel de synthèse vocale qui surligne le texte sur l’écran en même temps qu’il le lit, elle a découvert qu’elle peut se concentrer sur le contenu plus facilement au lieu de peiner devant chaque mot. La synthèse vocale lu est aussi utile avec les textes en ligne ; cependant l’expérience de Preety varie grandement d’un site web à l’autre. Certains sites utilisent des graphiques et des illustrations qui l’aident à se concentrer sur les sections et les contenus qu’elle souhaite lire, tandis que d’autres montrent beaucoup de publicités et de contenus qui bougent, ce qui la distrait. Elle a aussi des soucis avec les contenus en ligne où la navigation n’est pas assez claire. Elle trouve que les sites web et les applications qui fournissent plusieurs moyens de navigation, tels qu’une barre de navigation, un moteur de recherche, un fil d’Ariane, et un plan de site, sont bien plus faciles à utiliser. Le collège de Preety utilise aussi un nouveau logiciel pour sa bibliothèque dont l’accessibilité est meilleure. Avant cela, Preety était obligé de visiter physiquement la bibliothèque et de se faire aider pour faire ses recherches et trouver le matériel. Maintenant qu’elle fait ses recherches toute seule sur son téléphone mobile, sa tablette ou son ordinateur, Preety peine encore à orthographier correctement mais a découvert que la fonction de recherche (qui fournit des orthographes alternatives et des corrections d’erreurs) est très utile et améliore grandement son expérience.

Yun surfe régulièrement sur le Web pour lire des sites d’information. Ces dernières années il a aussi commencé à utiliser des médias sociaux pour rester en contact avec sa famille et ses amis. Il tient son propre blog où il publie des articles sur l’histoire de l’art et d’autres sujets qu’il apprécie. Comme de nombreuses personnes, Yun a des difficultés pour lire les textes écrits petits et pour cliquer sur de petits liens ou de petits éléments de formulaires. Sa fille lui a montré comment agrandir le texte dans son navigateur web, ce qui fonctionne bien pour de nombreux sites. Il rencontre des problèmes quand le texte ne s’affiche pas comme il faut quand on l’agrandit, et il est obligé de faire défiler la page de gauche à droite pour lire les contenus agrandis, ce qui lui fait rapidement perdre ses repères. Il a aussi des soucis avec les images de CAPTCHA qu’on trouve sur de nombreux sites de médias sociaux. Le texte est tellement déformé, même quand il l’agrandit, qu’il ne peut souvent pas saisir correctement le texte. Il a une meilleure expérience sur les sites qui utilisent des versions alternatives aux CAPTCHA, malheureusement seul un petit nombre d’entre eux en fournissent. La fille de Yun lui a donné une souris spéciale qui est plus facile à contrôler avec son tremblement. De plus, il utilise un navigateur qui enregistre des miniatures des sites qu’il visite fréquemment, ce qui lui permet plus facilement de retrouver les sites qu’il visite souvent.

Luis travaille dans un supermarché, il ensache les courses des clients. Il fait régulièrement ses courses dans le magasin où il travaille, mais il est parfois perdu devant le grand nombre de choix de produits, et il a quelquefois des difficultés à trouver ses produits favoris quand le magasin réorganise ses rayons. Dernièrement un ami lui a montré une application pour faire ses courses en ligne, qui fournit une navigation cohérente et facile à utiliser, avec des instructions directes et claires. Luis est capable d’ajouter dans l’application la liste des produits qu’il achète le plus souvent et de la sauvegarder pour pouvoir refaire ses courses. De plus, il aime la fonction de recherche qui fait des suggestions pour les mots mal orthographiés. L’application tient à jour une liste des articles dans son panier virtuel, ce qui l’aide à savoir combien il va dépenser. Son ami lui a aussi montré des fonctions d’accessibilité de son téléphone mobile qu’il trouve très utiles, comme la saisie prédictive qui fournit une sélection de mots possibles sur la base des premiers caractères qu’il a tapés, et la fonction de synthèse vocale qui lui permet d’écouter les avis d’autres clients dans l’application de courses. Grâce à ces outils, Luis a commencé à publier ses propres avis sur les produits qu’il a achetés. Luis utilise maintenant l’application de courses deux fois par mois pour retrouver les articles achetés fréquemment, et il achète régulièrement quelques produits frais dans le magasin où il travaille.

Kaseem utilise : un logiciel de zoom écran pour agrandir le texte des sites web jusqu’à une taille lisible, un logiciel de synthèse vocale qui affiche le texte sur une plage braille, un grand écran d’ordinateur avec une grande résolution et une forte luminosité. L’assistant électronique portable braille de Kaseem inclut un calendrier, un client mail, un navigateur web, et un outil de prise de notes. Son appareil mobile comprend un GPS qui l’aide à se repérer et à circuler en ville. Kaseem utilise le site des transports publics pour organiser ses déplacements et voir les horaires des bus, mais elle rencontre des problèmes quand elle agrandit le texte et qu’il ne se réorganise pas comme il faut, ce qui rend l’utilisation des cartes très difficile. Son expérience est meilleure avec les horaires de trains qui sont correctement balisés et permettent une réorganisation du texte. Kaseem a trouvé les informations de contact de l’équipe web sur le site des transports publics, et leur a envoyé un message pour leur expliquer les problèmes qu’elle rencontre sur leur site. Elle leur a aussi envoyé un lien vers le site web des trains en leur décrivant en quoi il fonctionne mieux pour elle. Elle a récemment reçu un message pour la remercier de ces informations et l’informer que l’équipe web des transports publics améliorera l’accessibilité du site web lors de sa prochaine version.

    "text": "Summary The following stories of people with disabilities using the Web highlight the effect of accessibility barriers and the broader benefits of accessible websites and web tools. Note: The following scenarios are not real people. They do not address every kind of disability. Page Contents Lee, online shopper with color blindness Alex, reporter with repetitive stress injury Martine, online student who is hard of hearing Ilya, senior staff member who is blind Preety, middle school student with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia Yun, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss Luis, supermarket assistant with Down syndrome Kaseem, teenager who is deaf and blind Lee, online shopper with color blindness Lee is colorblind and encounters barriers when shopping online. He has one of the most common visual disabilities that affect men: red and green color blindness. Lee frequently shops online and sometimes encounters problems on websites and with apps where the color contrast of text and images is not adequate and where color alone is used to indicate required fields and sale prices. When red and green color combinations are used, Lee cannot distinguish between the two, since both look brown to him. It is also very difficult for him to make product choices when color swatches are not labeled with the name of the color. Lee has better experiences with online content and apps that use adequate contrast and allow him to adjust contrast settings in his browser. He is also better able to recognize when information is required when asterisks are used. Lee can more easily identify the products he would like to purchase, especially clothing, when the color label names are included in the selection options rather than color swatches alone. For more information on implementing techniques that remove barriers for Lee, see the following resources: Sections related to Lee Diverse Abilities and Barriers Color blindness (Visual disabilities) Tools and Techniques Customized fonts and colors (Presentation) Accessibility principles: Content can be presented in different ways (Perceivable) Content is easier to see and hear (Perceivable) Content is compatible with current and future user tools (Robust) Alex, reporter with repetitive stress injury Alex has worked as a reporter for more than 20 years and has developed a repetitive strain injury that makes it painful to use a mouse and to type for extended periods of time. Though it took considerable research, time, and commitment to learn, he is able to work with less pain using the following modifications to his work environment: use of an ergonomic keyboard use of keyboard commands without a mouse voice recognition software on his computer and mobile phone assistive touch on his mobile phone Alex encounters problems when websites and other online content cannot be navigated by keyboard commands alone. He frequently encounters web forms that do not have keyboard equivalents. Sometimes it is also difficult to skip content and navigate to sections on a webpage without using many keyboard commands, which is very tiring and limits the time he can spend working comfortably. He also recently began to explore the use of assistive touch on his mobile phone which also helps him use fewer gestures and work for longer periods of time. As a temporary fix, Alex’s employer has built several custom work arounds that provide keyboard support for his use of the company’s internal Content Management System with the intention to implement improved keyboard support to benefit all users on the next release of the software.

She can hear some sounds, but not enough to understand speech. As a child she learned sign language and during her early school years learned written language. She is currently a student again, taking online college courses. The university she attends provides sign language interpreters and Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) writers who provide written verbatim text interpreting of spoken language for her courses. However, Martine has encountered barriers when video and other media content are not captioned. The university became aware of the need and requirement to provide captioned media and transcripts for audio content and is now working with a captioning provider to caption all content posted on university websites, including all course content in learning management systems. In addition to providing access to the content for students who are deaf or hard of hearing, the university has found that the use of captions and transcripts has added benefits. Transcripts facilitate easier production of subtitles in a number of languages and also improve the indexing of online content. Improved indexing provides improved search engine optimization and improved discoverability of the university’s online content. The university follows WCAG guidelines in providing the captioned content.

She is the chief accountant at an insurance company that uses web-based documents and forms over a corporate intranet and like many other blind computer users, she does not read Braille. Ilya uses a screen reader and mobile phone to access the web. Both her screen reader and her mobile phone accessibility features provide her with information regarding the device’s operating system, applications, and text content in a speech output form. When accessing web content, the screen reader indicates aloud the structural information on a webpage such as headings, column and row headers in tables, list items, links, form controls, and more that enable her to better navigate the page, complete and submit forms, and access information in an effective manner. She is able to listen to and understand speech output at a very high speed. Ilya encounters problems when websites are not properly coded and do not include alt text descriptions on images. These sites are unnavigable and require large amounts of time to read text from the top of the page to the bottom without navigation cues. Occasionally she finds herself trapped in areas on a webpage unable to move to another area and must abandon the page altogether. As a senior member of her organization, Ilya provides training to employees in online environments through the use of video conferencing applications, document and slide sharing applications as well as chat rooms. Ilya and her staff evaluated a number of training tools before finding an effective application with accessibility features that meet the needs of a diverse staff with diverse abilities.

Although she has substantial difficulty reading, she particularly enjoys her literature class. Preety’s school recently started using online digital textbooks. Preety was initially worried about using this new format, but with the use of text-to-speech software that highlights the text on the screen as it reads it aloud, she has found that she can focus on the content more easily instead of struggling over every word. The text-to-speech software is also helpful with other online text; however, Preety’s experience with websites varies greatly from one site to another. Some sites use graphics and illustrations in a way that helps her to focus on the sections and content that she would like to read, while other sites have a lot of advertisements and moving content that is very distracting. She also experiences problems with online content when the navigation is not clearly evident. She finds websites and apps that provide multiple means of navigation such as a navigation bar, search box, bread-crumb trails, and a sitemap to be much easier to use. Preety’s school is also using a new online library catalog with improved accessibility. Before the new catalog was implemented Preety had to physically visit the library to receive assistance in searching and locating material. Now she can search the catalog on her own using her mobile phone, tablet, or laptop. Preety still struggles with spelling but has found that search functionality that suggest alternative spellings and provide error corrections are very helpful and greatly improve her experience.

Yun regularly browses the web reading news sites. In recent years he also started using social media to stay in touch with his family and friends. He maintains his own blog where he posts articles on art history and other topics he enjoys. Like many older individuals, Yun has difficulty reading small text and clicking on small links and form elements. His daughter showed him how to enlarge text in the web browser, which works well on many websites. He encounters problems when text does not reflow when it is enlarged and he is forced to scroll back and forth to read the enlarged content, which means he easily loses track of his place. He also has problems with CAPTCHA images found on many social media sites. The text is so distorted, even when he enlarges it, that he often cannot accurately enter the text. He has a better experience on sites that use alternative CAPTCHA options, unfortunately only a small number currently do. Yun’s daughter gave him a special mouse that is easier to control with his hand tremors. He also uses a web browser that saves thumbnail images of his frequently visited sites, which makes it easier for him to keep track of the sites he goes to most often.

Luis works at a market, bagging groceries for customers. Typically he buys his groceries at the same market where he works, but he is sometimes confused by the large number of product choices and sometimes has problems finding his favorite items when the store layout is changed. Recently, a friend showed him an app for online grocery purchases that has consistent, easy-to-use navigation with clear and direct instructions. Luis is able to add the list of his most frequently purchased items into the app and save it for additional purchases. He also likes the search functionality that makes suggestions for mistyped or misspelled words. The app also keeps a running total of the items in his virtual shopping cart which helps him keep up with how much he is spending. His friend also showed him several accessibility features in his mobile phone that he finds very helpful including word prediction which provides a selection of possible word choices based on the first characters he enters and the text-to-speech functionality which allows him to listen to reviews posted by other users on the grocery app. With the use of these tools, Luis has begun posting his own reviews of items he has purchased. Luis now uses the shopping app a couple of times a month for frequently purchased items and buys a few fresh items regularly from the store where he works.

Kaseem uses: screen magnification software to enlarge the text on websites to a suitable font size; screen reader software that displays text on a refreshable Braille device; large computer screen with high resolution and high luminosity (brightness). Kaseem’s portable electronic Braille notetaker includes a calendar, e-mail, web browsing, and note-taking functionality. Her mobile device includes GPS which helps her orient herself and navigate around the city. Kaseem uses the public transportation online site to plan her trips and view bus schedules, but encounters problems when she enlarges the text and it does not reflow or wrap properly, making the maps very difficult to use. She has a better experience viewing the train schedules that are properly marked up and allow text reflow. Kaseem found the web team contact information listed at the public transportation website and sent a message to the team informing them of the problems she encountered using their site. She also sent them the link to the train website and described how that site works better for her. She recently received an email message thanking her for her information and informing her that the public transportation web team plans to implement accessibility improvements in the launch of their new website.

    "text": "Weave accessibility implementation throughout the process to minimize overhead and improve the overall quality of the final outcome. Prioritize quick wins and communicate progress to increase commitment and develop a sense of accomplishment. Build skills and expertise Improve accessibility awareness and develop core skills for key staff. Develop the accessibility skills of everyone involved, including designers, developers, content creators, and managers. This includes providing training for existing staff, as well as including accessibility skills in staff recruitment criteria. Examples of training include: Introductions to accessibility for everyone How accessibility benefits your business for management and project managers Accessible visual design for designers and marketing Accessible coding solutions for developers and testers Writing accessible content for non-technical content authors Document and share experience gathered throughout the processes to build expertise in creating accessible websites. Consider how to capture and communicate lessons learned, successful approaches, and good techniques. Include what didn’t work, as well as what did, to avoid time being spent on approaches known to have problems. Training is an initial investment that pays off as understanding of accessibility increases and it becomes more common practice. Increase knowledge should result in more accessible implementations first time, helping to reduce evaluation and rework costs and limit risk. For more information Developing Web Accessibility Presentations and Training – Provides guidance on creating training programmes customized to your particular needs. Tips for Getting Started with Web Accessibility – These tips introduce some basic considerations for making your website more accessible to people with disabilities. Web Accessibility Tutorials – Provides guidance on how to create specific components of websites to meet WCAG. Before and After Demo – Shows an inaccessible website and a retrofitted version of the same website with annotations. Integrate goals into policies Create a policy framework that builds accessibility throughout the organization. Integrate the goals from your accessibility policy within other organizational procedures and policies. This will help spread the responsibility but also ensure that accessibility is considered as an integral part of day-to-day activities. The following are some examples of where incorporating accessibility can bring broad benefits. Recruitment policies – Include relevant accessibility skills in general recruitment briefs and policies, to support the recruitment of staff expertise. Staff training – Provide accessibility training as part of staff and career development plans, to support the development of staff expertise. Document publishing process – Incorporate accessibility checks as part of your web content publishing workflow, to ensure that good practice is maintained and that final web content continues to be accessible. Procurement process – Ensure that suppliers are aware of your accessibility requirements by including criteria in any request for quotations and contracts. Depending on your organization there may be several other relevant procedures or policies that involve accessibility, such as equal employment policies, workspace accommodation, and customer care. Related activities Plan: Create accessibility policy Assign tasks and support delivery Assign tasks according to the set objectives and identified responsibilities. Track progress on the tasks and provide support where needed. Communicate deliverables and assignments to assigned team members. Ensure staff know what is expected of them, that they have the necessary capabilities, and are clear on schedules. Ensure that everyone has the resources to help them with their tasks. Provide a clear process for people to flag issues and ensure that any issues raised are managed and responded to efficiently. Individuals in multi-disciplinary teams are likely to have responsibility for meeting different parts of your accessibility standard. Be specific about each individual’s responsibility. For example, visual designers may be responsible for success criteria concerned with the visual elements of content, and developers are concerned with those related to the underlying code. Similarly, a contracts team may be responsible for ensuring that the procurement process includes accessibility requirements for third-party content. Depending on organization size, you may consider an accessibility task force that meets regularly to coordinate and verify progress among departments.

WCAG Overview – Provides information on WCAG, how it is structured, and how best to use it. How to Meet WCAG (Quick Reference) – A customizable quick reference to WCAG. Evaluate early and regularly Find and fix issues early in the process to reduce risk and cost. Evaluate accessibility throughout the design and development process, and particularly at key milestones and sprints. Evaluate key web pages, processes, and stand-alone components as they become available. Avoid evaluating accessibility separately and integrate checks iteratively within any current testing and quality assurance processes. Early evaluations of designs help identify problems and potential problems before significant work takes place. Other design resources, such as personas and user stories, can also be reviewed to include accessibility considerations. This will help designers better understand how people with disabilities interact with your website. Include input from users with disabilities as part of your evaluations. Encourage team members to attend testing sessions as this provides insight and context into barriers experienced by users. Use a standard report structure to capture evaluation findings. This allows for comparisons between different websites and across versions of the same website. Raise accessibility issues in an issue tracking system to ensure that it is allocated resources and fixed as part of the standard quality assurance cycle.

WCAG-EM Overview – Introduces a methodology for determining how well a website conforms to WCAG. Involving Users with Disabilities – Describes how to involve users to help better understand accessibility issues. Prioritize issues Use resources effectively by addressing high impact, easy-to-resolve issues first. While all accessibility objectives will need to be met, prioritizing can help you achieve them more effectively. Examples of prioritization include: Start with issues that are easier to fix, to help build motivation in the team and demonstrate success. Prioritize the development of accessible templates and components to support the creating of accessible content. Prioritize visual design to synchronize with an on-going re-branding activity within the organization. Prioritize recruitment or procurement policies to support anticipated hiring and acquisitions. De-prioritize issues that are related to tools or systems, such as a content management system (CMS), that are expected to be changed soon anyway. Involve different perspectives, including internal and external stakeholders, in the prioritization process. Review the situation regularly to benefit from arising opportunities. For more information Prioritize Solutions section of Improving the Accessibility of Your Website – Describes further prioritization criteria. Track and communicate progress Monitor progress towards accessibility goals and share the good and bad to maintain awareness and support. Track the progress made towards your accessibility objectives according to the assigned responsibilities and planned schedule. This includes progress on: Web content accessibility Implementation of procedures and policies Staff training and knowledge sharing Organizational awareness and attitude Share accessibility achievements, in particular with management, to help maintain and increase support for accessibility activities. Communicating lack of achievement can help highlight insufficient support or other systemic challenges and focus management on the need for urgent attention. Regular communication can help make the benefits of and challenges with accessibility implementation more transparent and easier to understand by your peers. For example, sharing successful training sessions, resources, and tools across departments could leverage knowledge and skills. Possible communication opportunities include: Reporting issue clearance rate to project management. Share highlight videos from user experience sessions with accessibility champions. Developer workshops to share good practice approaches. Related activities Initiate: Set objectives Plan: Establish monitoring framework",

    "text": "To succeed, a web accessibility effort must be well grounded in organizational culture, process, and practice. To do this, align accessibility with existing organizational approaches; develop and communicate clear, measurable objectives; and engage stakeholders to secure understanding and broad support throughout the organization. Learn the basics Find out what accessibility is and why it is important. The better you and your colleagues understand accessibility, the more effectively it can be implemented and promoted in your organization. Deepening your understanding of web accessibility helps you to address issues more effectively. Some sources for learning the basics include: Research introductory articles and videos Talk with colleagues, friends, and family members with disabilities Find training appropriate for your particular role Seek information or training from accessibility and disability organizations Set up assistive technology demonstrations and let people try them out First-hand experience of how people with disabilities access web content is often enlightening and inspiring. This can help you and others to understand the benefits and value of accessibility. What is web accessibility? Web accessibility fulfills the basic promise of the web - making information and communication readily available to all people regardless of barriers in geography, language, or disability. Integrating accessibility into websites brings broader benefits to organizations and other website visitors. For example, easier code maintenance and better user experiences, particularly on mobile devices. Related activities Implement: Build skills and expertise For more information Introduction to Web Accessibility – Introduces web accessibility and links to additional resources. How People with Disabilities Use the Web – Explores the impact of accessible design with real-life examples. Explore the current environment Learn the organization’s current state of accessibility and obligations to help determine the scope of work ahead. Explore and learn the current state of accessibility in your organization to help when initiating discussions with stakeholders, such as management. Several aspects of web accessibility can be checked fairly easily, with little or no technical skills required. This includes cursory checks of: Key websites and website user activities Web content policies and processes, such as those related to editing and publishing General awareness of and attitude towards accessibility and disability Understanding of accessibility law and policy as they effect your organization You may not be in the position to explore all these aspects in a first attempt. However, the more information you can gather, the better you will understand the types and sources of the issues that need to be addressed. Related activities Plan: Review websites Plan: Review environment For more information Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility – Provides simple steps to help assess if a web page addresses accessibility. Set objectives Clear objectives identify key deliverables, establish a timeline, and define how to measure success. Create objectives in response to identified accessibility problems and organizational goals. Develop measurable objectives that address accessibility gaps within the organization’s web content, processes, and policies. Objectives help to focus your team, clarify what activities need to be planned, define required deliverables, and ensure that successful delivery can be determined. Ensure that objectives have management agreement and support. This will help secure the necessary resources, align accessibility and business objectives, and reinforce your strategy. Also ensure that objectives help integrate accessibility into existing project frameworks, production workflows, or quality assurance processes. Examples of objectives might include: Develop accessibility policy by year-end. Include accessibility clauses in procurement within 6 months and enforce for all new Web procurement activities by year-end. Evaluate primary website and address any Level A and AA non-conformancies within 18 months. Prepare and deliver accessible writing course for all content authors by May. Modify design approval process to include accessibility considerations before June. Develop business case A strong business case helps gain buy-in from stakeholders and can make accessibility an organizational priority. Develop a tailored business case to respond to why accessibility should be addressed within your organization. The business case will be used to persuade stakeholders and management that web accessibility should be financially supported and prioritized. Depending on organizational priorities, the business case should explore: Direct impact for users with disabilities Broader benefits for everyone, such as usability Financial, time, and resource costs associated with not addressing accessibility early Legal aspects that may be applicable to your organization Impact on corporate social responsibility The business case should also outline the risks associated with ignoring accessibility, provide some indication of the resources needed, and specify how improvements will be tracked, and anticipated return on investment.

Mobile Accessibility – Summarizes existing and developing resources related to mobile accessibility. Web Accessibility and Older People – Introduces how the accessibility needs of older people with age-related impairments overlap with the accessibility needs of people with disabilities. Raise awareness Communicate the goals, value-adds, and importance of accessibility throughout the organization. Lack of awareness is a frequent reason for lack of accessibility adoption. Many people may know little or nothing about accessibility. Some may not appreciate that their role has an impact on website accessibility. Others may not be aware of the additional value that accessibility brings. A general introduction to accessibility, including organizational goals, will benefit everyone in the organization by improving awareness and building enthusiasm for the task. Consider audience needs and interests as you raise awareness of the benefits of web accessibility. Management will need to know about risk, budget, policy, and return on investment but designers may engage with understanding and solving the design challenges of accessibility. Developers may also enjoy the challenge of making modern designs accessible using new skills in HTML5, JavaScript, and ARIA. Marketing may be interested in user stories and demonstrating corporate responsibility. Consider inviting guest or expert speakers to organizational or departmental events to talk about accessibility. For more information Developing Web Accessibility Presentations and Training – Provides help on developing training on web accessibility. Gather support Organization-wide support is vital to ensure accessibility is distributed across the organization and sustained. Key stakeholder and management support will simplify the process of introducing or improving accessibility. Management support will help with prioritization clashes, access to resources, and communication activities. Use the business case to help secure support from these groups. Support for accessibility is often found among other project teams involved in the creation of websites. Encourage interest in these groups by exploring how accessibility has broad benefits. For example, individuals can improve their skills, organizations improve their websites, and people with disabilities have a better online experience. This will help increase the enthusiasm for accessibility and create more advocates or champions. Create opportunities to exchange information and provide support. This could be informal between interested individuals, such as chat channels and lunch gatherings, or more formal presentations to management during staff meetings or feedback sessions.

    "text": "Careful planning is critical to effective implementation of any accessibility effort. It ensures a clear assessment of the required work, distribution of tasks, and continual follow-up on progress. Create accessibility policy Document the accessibility goals, scope, and responsibilities important to your organization. A web accessibility policy captures your goals and targets. Policies vary across organizations but at a minimum establishes what web accessibility standard you aim to conform to and by when. For example, your policy might only state that your website will meet all criteria specified in WCAG 2.1 Level AA within one year. A policy may cover other topics such as roles and responsibilities, content preparation processes, quality assurance, infrastructure, and reporting. Ensure the policy has approval and backing from management. This will help all implementation activities, ensuring that resources are available and activities are prioritized. For more information Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility – Provides information on what needs to be considered when creating your policy. Assign responsibilities Understand what roles are needed to ensure all tasks are covered. Responsibility for delivering accessibility needs to be assigned to specific individuals and incorporated into their job description. Formalizing the responsibility helps ensure that the individual has time for the work and can receive training. Clear identification also helps communicate who is responsible for accessibility and that it is being prioritized. It is important to recognize that implementing accessibility is not only a concern for developers, but for the whole team. Spreading responsibilities throughout your project and organization increases awareness and reduces the risk of the activities overwhelming an individual or team. Some example responsibilities include: Marketing – Embed accessibility within brand or design guidelines. Quality assurance – Test for and track accessibility issues within the code. Development – Maintain code libraries with accessible components. Purchasing – Ensure that organizational accessibility policy is incorporated within procurement processes. Acceptance testing – Ensure that any agency-delivered website or component meets your desired level of accessibility. Recruitment – Incorporate accessibility skills within recruitment profiles. Determine budget and resources Ensure resources, including budgets, are clarified and secured for accessibility activities. This includes necessary reviews, training, audits, and testing with users. Your budget and resource needs depend on your accessibility goals and the extent of the work required to achieve them. For all activities consider what resources will be required and ensure that they are available. Some things that need to be considered include: Accessibility evaluations – Consider how frequently they need to occur and how extensive they need to be. Evaluation with people – Consider what opportunities exist to involve users with disabilities in evaluations. Reviews of policies and procedures – Time required to determine which policies need to be change, time required to make the changes, and time required to implement the changes. Recruitment – Organizations and teams may benefit from recruiting accessibility specialists or coordinators. Staff training – General awareness raising as well as specific training targeted on the needs of particular activities, such as website development or content writing. Tooling – Adaptation or possible replacement of content authoring tools, such as the content management system (CMS), or acquiring accessibility evaluation tools. Experienced support – Additional external support may be necessary while staff skills and knowledge improves. Once the budget is determined, ensure that you have sufficient approval. Your business case helps to secure budget, and you should ensure that the final budget is supported by estimates of how changes impact on previously set objectives and targets, and what return on investment could be expected. This might include better website performance, reduction in maintenance costs, higher sales, improved visitor statistics, or improved corporate social responsibility.

Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility – Provides information on the benefits of involving users and how to do it. Review environment Consider resources, processes, and tools in your organization that may impact accessibility efforts. The environment in which your websites are created and maintained has an equally significant impact on their accessibility. Also review these surrounding aspects, including: How well authoring tools support you in creating and maintaining accessible content; for example, does the content management system (CMS) support your accessibility commitments? What is the level of accessibility knowledge and expertise of the staff creating and maintaining your websites? How well is training support provided to improve the situation? Do staff have access to appropriate tools to assist in testing accessibility? Can accessibility be improved in design and development guidelines and specifications, shared templates and coding libraries, common authoring practices, and other centralized resources? Does any quality assurance plan include specific accessibility checks? How well do the existing policies and processes support your undertaking; for example, are there procurement policies to ensure purchasing of accessible tools and content? Having clear understanding of the issues will help you better address them. For example, you may identify that by improving the content management system (CMS) or with training, you can achieve your accessibility objectives much more effectively.

Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools List – List of vendor provided tools that help support accessibility evaluations. ATAG Overview – Provides information on Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG), how it is structured, and how best to use it. Review websites Identify issues to be fixed or avoided in existing websites. Perform a detailed accessibility review of websites in the scope of your objectives. This can create a baseline for future work, identify where training or additional expertise is needed, and help clarify how big a problem exists. The review may highlight instances of good practice, which identifies staff or suppliers who have critical skills to build on. Review results are helpful to identify problems to be avoided in future work, even if the objectives involve completely replacing an existing website. Results are also helpful in stakeholder reporting activities. Highlight existing problems and their impact so that later on, the impact of positive change can be put into context. Accessibility checks can be performed at all stages of the process, not only when the website is completed. For example, color choices can be checked on mocked-up website designs. By starting early and checking throughout the project you reduce the risk of being constrained by early design decisions that become expensive to change later on. Expert assistance may be required if your available resources do not have the skills and experience needed to undertake a thorough review.

Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility – Describes the benefits of involving users in projects and how to go about it. Establish monitoring framework Create a standard way of monitoring and reporting findings, in order to track and progress. Defined milestones help you measure your progress. Ensure that each milestone has specific and measurable criteria to indicate what progress has occurred. Some example criteria include: Number of WCAG Success Criteria passed, and their level. Number of complaints received related to accessibility. Calls handled from people who were unable to process their application online. Positive social media comments on accessibility of service. Training sessions on accessibility delivered to the staff. Ensure that accessibility progress is part of standard reporting for all parts of your organization that have been assigned any accessibility responsibility. It is valuable to develop a standard report structure to capture the measure of accessibility for websites or tools. This allows for comparisons between different websites and also between different versions of the same website. For long-term or ongoing goals you need to plan regular monitoring to ensure that achieved goals do not slip. For example, updates to content and website maintenance work may introduce new accessibility barriers or new staff may not have the necessary skills. Plan for regular reviews to monitor progress over time. Ensure that responsibility is assigned for the checks and there are clear escalation paths for identified issues. Related activities Initiate: Set objectives Implement: Evaluate early and regularly Engage with stakeholders Maintain long-term support through regular communication with management and other stakeholders. Engage with your stakeholders to bring them on board and to identify how they can help you meet your accessibility goals. This includes internal stakeholders such as project teams, marketing, and management, as well as external stakeholders such as suppliers, advocacy groups, and customers. For example: Introduce accessibility aspects in marketing campaigns. Report progress to management. Negotiate with suppliers to better support you with accessibility. Find out the latest accessibility trends for advocates and champions. Provide feedback channels to engage with your customers and end-users. Communicate your efforts publicly to help set expectations and increase internal commitment for accessibility. A public accessibility statement that identifies parts of your websites that work well and less well, explains accessibility improvements to come, and provides contact options for customers to report problems can help you overcome the transition period and gather feedback to prioritize repairs.",

    "text": "Keeping momentum helps with the accessibility maintenance for completed projects and builds on completed work for new projects. Regular reviews of content, organizational processes, and resources will help ensure that accessibility remains a priority and issues are identified. Developing a management reporting process will help ensure that it is clear where activity is required for follow-up work. Monitor websites Changing content can introduce accessibility issues, and provide opportunities for improvement. Monitor changes to identify issues and solutions. Coordinate closely with website owners to identify opportunities for improvement. This includes daily content publishing and maintenance activities, as well as broader redesign and development efforts. For example, knowing when website updates are scheduled and their scope can help reprioritize accessibility tasks to minimize effort. As your website content changes, ensure that regular accessibility reviews are performed. Include accessibility checks within the publishing process to help reduce the risk of issues occurring. Also provide a consistent evaluation process and reporting template. This will help comparison of findings to identify trends across websites or teams and help in management reporting activities. Reviews should seek to identify issues and also identify why those issues are occurring. Some questions to consider: Are issues caused by staff members who have not had sufficient training? Are they as a result of a change in the content management system (CMS)? Are the requirements of the publishing process unclear? Take action to correct the issues and also to remedy the reason for the issues occurring. Related activities Plan: Establish monitoring framework Engage with stakeholders Work with stakeholders to continually prioritize accessibility. Continued engagement with stakeholders will ensure that they are aware of the improvements in accessibility and resulting benefits. Internal stakeholders may be interested in how this is impacting the business and the effects on key performance indicators. External stakeholders are more likely to be interested in how your organization is progressing towards fulfilling stated accessibility goals. Keep working with external suppliers to improve the services and tools that they deliver. Work with internal stakeholders to ensure that accessibility remains a priority, particularly when it comes to new projects. Long-term engagement should also consider how accessibility changes are impacting project delivery. Are projects costing more? Is less time needed to ensure that accessibility is covered? Are there less problems at the end of projects? Changes in organizational structure may also be considered in the long-term and require the strategic view that senior stakeholders have. Examples include: Provide subject matter experts within each development team. Build accessibility support services within the organization. Prioritize accessibility during restructuring. Related activities Initiate: Gather support Track standards and legislation Keep up-to-date with changes to ensure that you are responding to the latest requirements. Review changes in standards and legislation that form part of your Accessibility Policy and consider any new standards or legislation that might add to your policy. These may have a broad impact on how you manage accessibility and will need to be planned with care. Create a process to track changes in standards that provides you with sufficient opportunity to respond in good time. Changes in legislation tend to include dates by which compliance must be achieved. This can be helpful if you need to gather support, and will usually require involved planning to ensure that changes are implemented in time. Standards may change to cover additional areas of accessibility or respond to new technology. This might require new design and coding approaches for existing websites. Also review any existing common libraries, knowledge bases, and training material to ensure that the current standards are correctly reflected. For more information WAI Interest Group – Public group with a mailing list for general discussion on Web accessibility and W3C standards announcements. Adapt to new technologies Update resources and websites in response to changes in web technologies. Consider what technologies you aim to support and ensure that you track functionality that changes each version. This will include what baseline browsers and assistive technologies you support and also the authoring tools that you use, such as your content management system. Baseline support list Update the list of browsers and assistive technologies that are supported for website development. New versions will bring new features and improved support for existing standards. Consider what additional accessibility support new versions will bring and determine what additional work might be needed to take advantage of them. Any work can then be fed into the next iteration of the site. Similarly, new versions of your authoring tools may provide additional accessibility features that you can take advantage of. You may need to update training or provide extra training so that content authors are able to use new features. Consider suggesting accessibility improvements back to authoring tool vendors. Hardware Upgrades to hardware are generally less frequent than software changes, but should also be considered. This includes new consumer devices intended to access the Web as well as new assistive technologies. Explore new technology as it becomes commonly available and consider what changes might be necessary to support accessibility. For assistive technologies, consider working with advocacy organizations to identify new technologies and what changes may be necessary to support them. Incorporate user feedback Invite user feedback and use it to help guide improvement activities and identify areas in need of attention. Ensure that any on-going customer support is able to respond to user accessibility issues. This will include training for first line support and also clear escalation paths for issues that cannot be resolved immediately. Inform the user who raised the issue of any escalation that requires more involved changes and when improvements might be expected. Communicate accessibility improvements on your website in the Accessibility Statement. Make it easy for website users to submit feedback on accessibility and ensure that any feedback is used when considering future improvements.

Relevant WCAG Resources: From Understanding WCAG 2.0: Understanding Conformance Understanding Accessibility Support Workshop review and lessons learned — Day 3 Session 5 Target audience: Web developers and application programmers Session Objectives: Ensure participants have understood the key messages from the workshop Provide an opportunity for questions and answers to outstanding issues Outline: General questions and answers (Q&amp;A) to elaborate on anything needing clarification Summary of the overall requirements for accessible web design and development Reiteration of the value of using “How to Meet WCAG (Quick Reference)” as a gateway to WCAG Opportunities for follow-up, including the WAI Interest Group (and the associated WAI-IG email list) Suggested activity: Ask participants to write down something they learned in the last two days that they will incorporate in their work immediately, something that surprised them, or the most interesting thing they learned. Discuss some of the impressions from the participants to share lessons learned. Important Notes This example workshop is not a complete set of training material. Trainers will need to adapt the material to suit their audience. For example, for an in-house workshop, trainers should focus on the issues most common to the organization’s content and development environment, and could use the organization’s website and authoring tools for examples and activities. This material assumes that trainers are experienced web accessibility practitioners and trainers. That is, it does not attempt to train trainers. This outline is for an initial workshop. Follow up workshops might be needed. For example, content authors would benefit from specific instruction on how to use their content management system (CMS) or other authoring tools to provide accessible content. Additional notes for presenters for the technical sessions on days 2 and 3 Allow time at the end of each session to sum up the requirements and clarify any issues arising from the session. Finish days 1 and 2 with a brief summary of the day, and start days 2 and 3 with a brief summary of the previous day. Seek feedback at the end of each day and adjust remaining material as appropriate. Clarify that not all WCAG success criteria are being presented and discussed in this workshop. Describe the intent of accessibility requirements, and their relationship to barriers for people with disabilities and older people. Also describe the broader benefits for mobile users, search engine optimization (SEO), and more. Draw illustrative examples from sites and material that are relevant to the participants backgrounds, e.g. government, commerce, etc. The Before and After Demonstration provides accessible and inaccessible web pages, including evaluation reports, that can be used as examples. Using the participants’ own websites or similar websites to theirs (such as websites from competitor organizations) helps make the examples more tangible. Emphasize the benefits of How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference), a customizable quick reference to WCAG requirements and techniques, including ‘best practice’ advisory techniques. Introduce appropriate evaluation techniques and tools for each issue as it is covered. Carry out activities and exercises to reinforce the learning effect.",

    "text": "Summary This page introduces some basic considerations to help you get started making your user interface design and visual design more accessible to people with disabilities. These tips are good practice to help you meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) requirements. Follow the links to the related WCAG requirements, detailed background in the “Understanding” document, guidance from Tutorials, user stories, and more. Page Contents Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background Don’t use color alone to convey information Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify Provide clear and consistent navigation options Ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels Provide easily identifiable feedback Use headings and spacing to group related content Create designs for different viewport sizes Include image and media alternatives in your design Provide controls for content that starts automatically Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background Foreground text needs to have sufficient contrast with background colors. This includes text on images, background gradients, buttons, and other elements. This does not apply for logos, or incidental text, such as text that happens to be in a photograph. The links below provide more information on the minimum contrast ratio as required by the WCAG and how to check contrast. “Contrast ratio” is a short version of the more technically correct term “luminance contrast ratio”. Example: Contrast ratio Insufficient Some people cannot read text if there is not sufficient contrast between the text and background. For others, bright colors (high luminance) are not readable; they need low luminance. Sufficient Some people cannot read text if there is not sufficient contrast between the text and background. For others, bright colors (high luminance) are not readable; they need low luminance. More Information WCAG Contrast (Minimum) 1.4.3 (Understanding 1.4.3) User Story How a user with “color blindness” experiences the Web Easy Check How to check contrast ratio Support Tools List of tools to help determine contrast ratio Don’t use color alone to convey information While color can be useful to convey information, color should not be the only way information is conveyed. When using color to differentiate elements, also provide additional identification that does not rely on color perception. For example, use an asterisk in addition to color to indicate required form fields, and use labels to distinguish areas on graphs. Example: Using color to convey meaning Color only Required fields are in red Name Email Color and symbol Required fields are in red and marked with an * Name Email * Example: Refer to something using color alone Color only Four triangles with different angles Which is the right-angled triangle? Green Blue Red Yellow Don't know Color and number 1Green triangle: Angles are 30°, 60°, 90° 2 Blue triangle: Angles are 30°, 30°, 120° 3 Red triangle: Angles are 30°, 60°, 90° 4 Yellow triangle: Angles are 40°, 70°, 70° Which is the right-angled triangle? Green (1) Blue (2) Red (3) Yellow (4) Don't know More Information WCAG Use of Color 1.4.1 (Understanding 1.4.1) User Story How a user with “color blindness” experiences the Web Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify Provide distinct styles for interactive elements, such as links and buttons, to make them easy to identify. For example, change the appearance of links on mouse hover, keyboard focus, and touch-screen activation. Ensure that styles and naming for interactive elements are used consistently throughout the website. Example: Unique styles for different link states Style links to stand out from text Some people can't use a mouse and use only a keyboard to navigate through web pages. It is important that users can reach all interactive elements using the keyboard, and that it is clear which element has focus. Visible keyboard focus could be a border or highlight that moves as you tab through the web page. Mouse hover style keyboard to navigate Keyboard focus style keyboard to navigate Touch or click style keyboard to navigate More Information WCAG Focus Visible 2.4.7 (Understanding 2.4.7) Consistent Identification 3.2.4 (Understanding 3.2.4) User Story Challenges faced by someone with a limited ability to use a mouse Challenges faced by an older user with hand tremors Provide clear and consistent navigation options Ensure that navigation across pages within a website has consistent naming, styling, and positioning. Provide more than one method of website navigation, such as a site search or a site map. Help users understand where they are in a website or page by providing orientation cues, such as breadcrumbs and clear headings. More Information WCAG Consistent Navigation 3.2.3 (Understanding 3.2.3) Multiple Ways 2.4.5 (Understanding 2.4.5) User Story How consistency and navigation can help someone with cognitive difficulties Ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels Ensure that all fields have a descriptive label adjacent to the field. For left-to-right languages, labels are usually positioned to the left or above the field, except for checkboxes and radio buttons where they are usually to the right. Avoid having too much space between labels and fields. Example: Labels and input fields associated by proximity Add a comment Your E-mail I am happy for you to contact me Your Website Comment More Information WCAG Labels or Instructions 3.3.2 (Understanding 3.3.2) Headings and Labels 2.4.6 (Understanding 2.4.6) Tutorial Visual position of label text User Story How clear labelling can help someone with cognitive difficulties Provide easily identifiable feedback Provide feedback for interactions, such as confirming form submission, alerting the user when something goes wrong, or notifying the user of changes on the page. Instructions should be easy to identify. Important feedback that requires user action should be presented in a prominent style. Example: Using error list, icon, and background color to make errors stand out Please correct the following errors: Email address is invalid A Comment is required Add a comment Required fields are in red and marked with an * Name E-mail * Website Comment * More Information WCAG Error Identification 3.3.1 (Understanding 3.3.1) Labels or Instructions 3.3.2 (Understanding 3.3.2) Error Suggestion 3.3.3 (Understanding 3.3.3) Tutorial User Notifications User Story How making important content easily identifiable can help Use headings and spacing to group related content Use whitespace and proximity to make relationships between content more apparent. Style headings to group content, reduce clutter, and make it easier to scan and understand. Example: Spacing highlights relationship between content Little spacing and unclear relationship Single heading with large blocks of text, poor separation of sub-headings, and unclear image relationship Main heading Sub heading Sub heading More spacing and clearer relationship Main heading, multiple sub headings, lists, and no large text blocks Main heading Sub heading Sub heading More Information WCAG Headings and Labels 2.4.6 (Understanding 2.4.6) Section Headings 2.4.10 (Understanding 2.4.10) Tutorial Headings User Story Describes how headings can be helpful for navigation Create designs for different viewport sizes Consider how page information is presented in different sized viewports, such as mobile phones or zoomed browser windows. Position and presentation of main elements, such as header and navigation can be changed to make best use of the space. Ensure that text size and line width are set to maximize readability and legibility. Example: Content and navigation adapt to smaller mobile screen Display in a wide window with small text uses multiple columns for primary content, visible navigation options, and visible secondary information. Display in a narrow window, such as a mobile phone, or with large text uses single column for primary content, navigation options are revealed using an icon, and secondary information is also revealed via icon. More Information Background Small Screen Size Mobile considerations related to Understandability User Story Describes how alternative views of zoomed pages can be helpful Include image and media alternatives in your design Provide a place in your design for alternatives for images and media. For example, you might need: Visible links to transcripts of audio Visible links to audio described versions of videos Text along with icons and graphical buttons Captions and descriptions for tables or complex graphs Work with content authors and developers to provide alternatives for non-text content. Example: Design includes links to a transcript and to an audio described video More Information WCAG Non-text Content 1.1.1 (Understanding 1.1.1) Tutorial Images User Story Describes the value of text alternatives to a blind user Provide controls for content that starts automatically Provide visible controls to allow users to stop any animations or auto-playing sound. This applies to carousels, image sliders, background sound, and videos.

Page Contents Associate a label with every form control Include alternative text for images Identify page language and language changes Use mark-up to convey meaning and structure Help users avoid and correct mistakes Reflect the reading order in the code order Write code that adapts to the user’s technology Provide meaning for non-standard interactive elements Ensure that all interactive elements are keyboard accessible Avoid CAPTCHA where possible Associate a label with every form control Use a for attribute on the &lt;label&gt; element linked to the id attribute of the form element, or using WAI-ARIA attributes. In specific situations it may be acceptable to hide &lt;label&gt; elements visually, but in most cases labels are needed to help all readers understand the required input. Example: Using for and id attributes Rendered Username Code Snippet &lt;label for=\"username\"&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=\"username\" type=\"text\" name=\"username\"&gt; More Information WCAG Labels or Instructions 3.3.2 (Understanding 3.3.2) Tutorial Labeling Controls Include alternative text for images Ensure that alternative text for images is added to all informational and functional images. Use empty alternative text, alt=\"\" for decorative images, or include them in the CSS instead. Text alternatives are usually provided by those responsible for written content. More Information WCAG Non-text Content 1.1.1 (Understanding 1.1.1) Tutorial Images User Story Describes the value of text alternatives to a blind user Identify page language and language changes Indicate the primary language of every page by using the lang attribute in the html tag, for example &lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;. Use the lang attribute on specific elements when the language of the element differs from the rest of the page. More Information WCAG Language of Page 3.1.1 (Understanding 3.1.1) Language of Parts 3.1.2 (Understanding 3.1.2) How To Declaring language in HTML Use mark-up to convey meaning and structure Use appropriate mark-up for headings, lists, tables, etc. HTML5 provides additional elements, such as &lt;nav&gt; and &lt;aside&gt;, to better structure your content. WAI-ARIA roles can provide additional meaning, for example, using role=\"search\" to identify search functionality. Work with designers and content writers to agree on meanings and then use them consistently. Example: Using HTML to provide structure and meaning Rendered Superbear saves the day 7 Aug 2015 The city's favorite bear yet again proves his mettle by rescuing a young cat from a tree. Witnesses say that Superbear's efforts were not appreciated by the feline, who inflicted some minor scratch wounds on his rescuer.

When an error occurs: Help users find where the problem is Provide specific, understandable explanations Suggest corrections Be as forgiving of format as possible when processing user input. For example, accept phone numbers that include spaces and delete the spaces as needed. Example: Australian phone number field with forgiving validation Rendered Phone For example, (02) 1234 1234 Code Snippet &lt;label for=\"phone\"&gt;Phone&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=\"phone\" name=\"phone\" type=\"tel\" pattern=\"^(\\(?0[1-9]{1}\\)?)?[0-9 -]*$\" aria-describedby=\"phone-desc\"&gt; &lt;p id=\"phone-desc\"&gt;For example, (02) 1234 1234&lt;/p&gt; More Information WCAG Error Identifications 3.3.1 (Understanding 3.3.1) Tutorial Validating Input User Story Describes how helpful errors help a user with dyslexia Reflect the reading order in the code order Ensure that the order of elements in the code matches the logical order of the information presented. One way to check this is to remove CSS styling and review that the order of the content makes sense. Example: Reflecting the logical reading order in the code Space trainers Space trainer for a classic and stylish look.

When font size is increased by at least 200%, avoid horizontal scrolling and prevent any clipping of content. Use progressive enhancement to help ensure that core functionality and content is available regardless of technology being used. Example: Using media queries to adapt navigation /* On narrow viewports, make the navigation full width */ @media screen and (min-width: 25em) { #nav { float: none; width: auto; } #main { margin-left: 0; } } /* On wider viewports, put the navigation on the left */ @media screen and (min-width: 43em) { #nav { float: left; width: 24%; } #main { margin-left: 27%; } } More Information WCAG Resize text 1.4.4 (Understanding 1.4.4) Consistent Identification 3.2.4 (Understanding 3.2.4) Background Small Screen Size User Story Describes how alternative views of zoomed pages can be helpful Provide meaning for non-standard interactive elements Use WAI-ARIA to provide information on function and state for custom widgets, such as accordions and custom-made buttons. For example, role=\"navigation\" and aria-expanded=\"true\". Additional code is required to implement the behavior of such widgets, such as expanding and collapsing content or how the widget responds to keyboard events. Example: Menu function and state identified using WAI-ARIA &lt;nav aria-label=\"Main Navigation\" role=\"navigation\"&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"...\"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"...\"&gt;Shop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class=\"has-submenu\"&gt; &lt;a aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" href=\"...\"&gt;SpaceBears&lt;/a&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"...\"&gt;SpaceBear 6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"...\"&gt;SpaceBear 6 Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"...\"&gt;MarsCars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"...\"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/nav&gt; More Information WCAG Name, Role, Value 4.1.2 (Understanding 4.1.2) Background Notes on Using ARIA in HTML Ensure that all interactive elements are keyboard accessible Think about keyboard access, especially when developing interactive elements, such as menus, mouseover information, collapsable accordions, or media players. Use tabindex=\"0\" to add an element that does not normally receive focus, such as &lt;div&gt; or &lt;span&gt;, into the navigation order when it is being used for interaction. Use scripting to capture and respond to keyboard events. Example: Keyboard accessible menu button Rendered Menu About News Tickets Fun Code Snippet var buttonExample = document.getElementById('example-button'); buttonExample.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) { // Toggle the menu when RETURN is pressed if(e.keyCode &amp;&amp; e.keyCode == 13) { toggleMenu(document.getElementById('example-button-menu')); } }); buttonExample.addEventListener('click', function(e) { // Toggle the menu on mouse click toggleMenu(document.getElementById('example-button-menu')); }); More Information WCAG Keyboard 2.1.1 (Understanding 2.1.1) User Story Describes how a user with RSI needs keyboard support Avoid CAPTCHA where possible CAPTCHAs create problems for many people. There are other means of verifying that user input was generated by a human that are easier to use, such as automatic detection or interface interactions. If CAPTCHA really needs to be included, ensure that it is simple to understand and includes alternatives for users with disabilities, such as: Providing more than two ways to solve the CAPTCHAs Providing access to a human representative who can bypass CAPTCHA Not requiring CAPTCHAs for authorized users.

Page Contents Provide informative, unique page titles Use headings to convey meaning and structure Make link text meaningful Write meaningful text alternatives for images Create transcripts and captions for multimedia Provide clear instructions Keep content clear and concise Provide informative, unique page titles For each web page, provide a short title that describes the page content and distinguishes it from other pages. The page title is often the same as the main heading of the page. Put the unique and most relevant information first; for example, put the name of the page before the name of the organization. For pages that are part of a multi-step process, include the current step in the page title. Example: Page Titles Home page title Space Teddy Inc. Page name followed by organization name Latest News &bull; Space Teddy Inc. Page name including step in a process Buy Your Bear (Step 1 of 3) &bull; Space Teddy Inc. More Information WCAG Page Titled 2.4.2 (Understanding 2.4.2) Use headings to convey meaning and structure Use short headings to group related paragraphs and clearly describe the sections. Good headings provide an outline of the content. Example: Using headings to organize content Lack of headings View inline example Example: Headings and Subheadings HTML elements provide information on structural hierarchy of a document. Using elements correctly will help convey additional meaning to assistive technology. In many cases, doing so will also make your document easier to edit. For documents longer than three or four paragraphs, headings and subheadings are important for usability and accessibility. They help readers to determine the overall outline of a document and to navigate to specific information of interest. Headings are classified into levels from one to six. The highest level is \"Level 1\" and often corresponds to the title of the page or major document section. Visual readers identify headers by scanning pages for text of a larger size or a different style. Assistive technology users are not able to see these visual changes, so changing the style is not a sufficient cue. Instead, the headings must be semantically \"tagged\" so that assistive technology can identify headings. Then headings can also be used for navigation. This makes adding headings one of the most important tools for screen reader users, so that they can learn what is on the page. Note that tagging usually triggers a formatting change visually which can be adjusted in many documents.

Write in short, clear sentences and paragraphs. Avoid using unnecessarily complex words and phrases. Consider providing a glossary for terms readers may not know. Expand acronyms on first use. For example, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Consider providing a glossary for terms readers may not know. Use list formatting as appropriate. Consider using images, illustrations, video, audio, and symbols to help clarify meaning. Example: Making content readable and understandable Unnecessarily complex CPP: In the event of a vehicular collision, a company assigned representative will seek to ascertain the extent and cause of damages to property belonging to all parties involved. Once our representative obtains information that allows us to understand the causality, we may or may not assign appropriate monetary compensation. The resulting decision may occasion one of the following options: the claim is not approved and is assigned a rejected status, the status of the claim is ambiguous and will require additional information before further processing can occur, the claim is partially approved and reduced payment is assigned and issued, or claim is fully approved and total claim payment is assigned and issued. Easier to understand Claims Processing Procedure (CPP): If you have a car accident, our agent will investigate. Findings will determine any claim payment. This could result in: Approved claim - full payment Partially approved claim - reduced payment Undetermined claim - more information needed Rejected claim - no payment More Information WCAG Reading Level 3.1.5 (Understanding 3.1.5) Unusual Words 3.1.3 (Understanding 3.1.3) Abbreviations 3.1.4 (Understanding 3.1.4) User Story User with reading disabilities benefits from easy to read text Learn More About Accessibility These tips are a few of the things you need to consider for web accessibility.

Often they are not aware of the relationship between the accessibility needs of older users and the needs of people with disabilities. In fact, they may not even be aware of the existence of standards for Web accessibility at all. This resource would explain to them how they could benefit from implementing existing Web accessibility guidelines, and how to use them to create accessible Web sites for older users. Scenarios Jane DeVeloper has been told to make her website work well for older users. This document should show her how to use WCAG as her guide for doing so. Jane has a sister Jessica, also a web developer: Jane needs to design her website for older people; she is not aware of accessibility or WCAG Jessica knows about accessibility and WCAG; she wants to get information specifically on designing for older users The web manager at Acme insurance wants to better meet the needs of older people as one of their key customer groups. This doc should help him integrate the requirements of old people into their ongoing accessibility work. Researcher looking to develop guidelines/recommendations for older web users. This document should demonstrate how WCAG 2.0 covers the accessibility requirements. Purpose, Goals, Objectives Rationale: Many web developers: do not appreciate the relevance of the WAI guidelines for older people do not know about the accessibility requirements of older users with changing abilities do not understand the importance of the WCAG 2.0 advisory techniques Some independent ‘senior friendly’ guidelines have been developed which parallel WAI guidelines, but fragment standardization efforts Objective: Underline the relevance of the WAI guidelines for older users Provide web developers with information about the importance of WCAG 2.0 for older users Highlight the relevance of advisory techniques from WCAG 2, especially for people who do not use assistive technology Contribute to the harmonization of web accessibility rather the development of separate recommendations for older users Catch people focusing on older audience and show that WCAG provides what they need (and by the way, make it accessible to everyone while you’re at it) Audience Primary: Web developers (including web application programmers, website designers, information architects, content writers and editors, etc) primary group - people developing for older people and unaware of WCAG secondary group - accessibility aware, but looking for older people guidance Secondary: Website procurers and commissioners Policy makers Managers &amp; other decision makers Advocates and older peoples’ organizations Scope Will: Highlight aspects of WCAG 2.0 of particular importance to older users with accessibility needs due to ageing Provide tips and best-practices for website development, including WCAG 2.0 sufficient &amp; advisory techniques Point to further resources about website development, especially those developed through WAI-AGE Will not: Be a step-by-step guide to accessible development Repeat material already included in other WAI documents (but will cross reference them, especially WAI-AGE ones, as appropriate) Approach Initial outline and ideas: Introduction stress overlap of requirements for older users and people with disabilities consider mentioning: many previous studies made recommendations WRT older people that are covered or paralleled by WCAG 2.0 many of the identified requirements for older web users are met by advisory techniques Background stress importance of WAI guidelines (refer Lit Review) mention the importance of the browser and UAAG for people who don’t use assistive technologies point to How People with Disabilities Use the Web point to Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization: Overview Requirements / Mapping / @@ mapping of needs and requirements with WCAG 2.0 drawn from WAI Guidelines and Older Web Users: Findings from a Literature Review (draft) and related documents probably simplified - maybe by GL/SC and particular technique of additional importance Implementation (tips and best practices) mention the importance of content authors, writers, editors, and others preparing content in addressing requirements of older users mention importance of authoring tools (include CMS) in achieving web accessibility -

It highlights the relationship between the accessibility needs of older users and the needs of people with disabilities, and guides the readers to more in-depth resources such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, the WAI-AGE Literature Review documents, or other relevant resources. Proposal: In some situations, developers are tasked to create Web sites for older users. Often they are not aware of the relationship between the accessibility needs of older users and the needs of people with disabilities. In fact, they may not even be aware of the existence of standards for Web accessibility at all. This resource would explain to them how they could benefit from existing Web accessibility guidelines, and how to use them to create accessible Web sites for older users. Requirements Groupings option A second attempt to organise material by the types of needs older users have, then show how WCAG 2.0 meets those needs. Trying the approach and presentation style used in Shared Web Experiences: Barriers Common to Mobile Device Users and People with Disabilities. Groupings based on WAI Guidelines and Older Web Users: Findings from a Literature Review plus meeting identified impairments. Techniques drawn from early draft of Developing Websites for Older People (June 2010). Need to emphasize that any success criteria not listed still need to be met! Questions: Is this ‘requirements’ approach working? Is the organisation/categorisation good? (Too many? Too few?) Is the level of explanation of each requirement sufficient?

(future link) [advisory] Option 2: Older people experience X with Y implication, so do Z Sensory Characteristics - Success Criterion 1.3.3 (A) {#sensory-characteristics—success-criterion-1.3.3-a-1 .listintro} Older people experiencing sensory declines who may not see or hear well will benefit from this criterion. Timing adjustable - Success Criterion 2.2.1 (A) {#timing-adjustable—success-criterion-2.2.1-a-1 .listintro} Many older people experience vision decline that can make reading difficult, and might also experience various cognitive declines affecting their concentration or short-term memory. These impairments can mean that some older people might need longer to read, understand and complete online tasks than others. On Focus - Success Criterion 3.2.1 (A) {#on-focus—success-criterion-3.2.1-a-1 .listintro} Older people can experience declining cognitive abilities and [have been observed to sometimes experience difficulty with forms]{.listintro} so using “activate” rather than “focus” as a trigger for changes of context and not causing persistent changes of state or value when a component receives focus can be helpful. Older people have been observed to experience difficulties with new browser windows, so providing advanced warning and only using these when when best from an accessibility perspective is good practice. — end Alternative Success Criteria Rationale Expressions —   {#lp}Landing Page for Older Users ----------------------------------- Published: &lt;http://www.w3.org/WAI/older-users&gt; **Purpose:** - to act as an introductory page to the overlap between design for older users and web accessibility - to link to WAI resources that specifically address issues with designing for older users **Audience:** - everyone interested in developing websites that meet the needs of older users **References:** - [EOWG minutes 21 May 2010](http://www.w3.org/2010/05/21-eo-minutes.html) - [EOWG minutes 12 Feb 2010](http://www.w3.org/2010/02/12-eo-minutes.html#item02) - [Feb 2010 version](http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/older-users2010-02Feb-12) **Title considerations (landing page):** - Design for Older Users and Web Accessibility Overlaps - Web Accessibility and Older Users - Designing for Older Users and Web Accessibility Overlaps - Overlaps in Designing for Older Users and Web Accessibility - Web Accessibility and Older People - Web Accessibility and Older People: Existing Guidelines for People with Disabilities Meet the Needs of Older Users - Web Accessibility and Older People: Broadening Access to Older Web Users - Web Accessibility and Older People: Providing Access to Older Web Users - Web Accessibility and Older People: Ensuring Access for Older Web Users - Web Accessibility and Older People: Guidelines and Access for Older Web Users - Web Accessibility and Older People: Meeting the Requirements of Older Web Users - Web Accessibility and Older People: Meeting the Needs of Older Web Users - Web Accessibility and Older People: Guidelines for meeting the Needs of Older Web Users - Web Accessibility and Older People: Resources for meeting the Needs of Ageing Web Users - Web Accessibility and Older People: Best Practices for meeting the Needs of Older Web Users &lt;/div&gt;",

    "title": "Developing Websites for Older People: How Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Applies",
    "text": "Summary An extensive literature review identified that existing standards from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) address the accessibility needs of older web users. This page introduces how to use Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 to improve the accessibility and usability of websites and web applications for older people. Please see Web Accessibility and Older People: Meeting the Needs of Ageing Web Users for additional background and resources on the overlapping needs of older people and people with disabilities. Page Contents About WCAG 2.0 How WCAG 2.0 Applies to Older People Perceivable information and user interface Text size Text style and text layout Color and contrast Multimedia Text-to-speech (speech synthesis) CAPTCHA Operable user interface and navigation Links Navigation and location Mouse use Keyboard use and tabbing Distractions Sufficient time Understandable information and user interface Page organization Understandable language Consistent navigation and labeling Pop-ups and new windows Page refresh and updates Instructions and input assistance Error prevention and recovery for forms Robust content and reliable interpretation Older equipment/software About WCAG 2.0 The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 includes organizing principles and guidelines, and has success criteria at three levels: A, AA, AAA. WAI recommends meeting at least all WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria. A related document provides techniques that include specific details on meeting the success criteria, such as code examples. WAI encourages developers to use the How to Meet WCAG 2.0 quick reference to access the guidelines, success criteria, and techniques, along with the additional descriptions, examples, and resources from “Understanding WCAG 2.0”. To learn more about WCAG, see: WCAG Overview - provides background, an introduction to WCAG, and links to additional information The WCAG 2.0 Documents - describes the different WCAG 2.0 technical and supporting documents How to Meet WCAG 2.0 - is a customizable quick reference to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 requirements (Success Criteria) and techniques How WCAG 2.0 Applies to Older People This section explains how many of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 guidelines and success criteria specifically meet the needs of older web users. Although not all the WCAG 2.0 success criteria are listed here, WAI recommends meeting at least all WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria. Some of the Level AAA success criteria that are particularly important for older people are listed in this section too. When implementing WCAG 2.0, developers can use different techniques to meet the success criteria. In some cases, using one technique instead of another can optimize accessibility for certain users. This section lists some of the techniques that can help optimize websites for older people. (Many of the techniques link to additional information; those with “(future link)” will be written up with later edits to the WCAG Techniques.) This section is organized under the four principles of web accessibility from WCAG 2.0: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Success criteria are listed thematically, to help readability. Sometimes they are drawn from different guidelines to address a particular aspect. Perceivable information and user interface Text size Many older people require large text due to declining vision, including text in form fields and other controls. WCAG 2.0 success criteria: 1.4.4 - Resize text (AA) says “text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality” Example techniques to consider: Using relative font-sizes such as percent (C12) or ems (C14) and ensuring text containers resize (C28) Providing large fonts by default (future link) C17: Scaling form elements which contain text Avoiding the use of text in raster images (future link) G178: Providing controls on the Web page that allow users to incrementally change the size of all text on the page up to 200 percent More techniques are listed under 1.4.4 - Resize text in “How to Meet WCAG 2.0”. Literature review reference: Vision decline with ageing. Text style and text layout Text style and its visual presentation impacts how hard or easy it is for people to read, especially older people with declining vision.

    "title": "Older Users and Web Accessibility: Meeting the Needs of Ageing Web Users",
    "text": "Summary Designing products that are easier for older people to use is similar to designing for people with disabilities. Guidance on how to make your websites, web applications, and web tools work better for older users is covered in existing international accessibility standards from the W3C, including Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Page Contents Background Overlapping Needs: People who are Elderly and People with Disabilities Guidelines and Other Standards Specific Guidance on Designing for Older Users Advocating and Educating Background Older web users are an increasing market segment and an important target group for many businesses, governments, and other organizations. The European Commission-funded WAI-AGE Project researched: the needs of older web users, existing guidance for addressing older user needs, and the overlap with web accessibility for people with disabilities. The results of the research and subsequent work determined that existing international accessibility standards from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) address most older user needs. More Background: Literature Review and Article Overview of \"Web Accessibility for Older Users: A Literature Review\" Provides a brief introduction of the scope, audience, and content of the Literature Review . Older Users Online - WAI Guidelines Address Older Users’ Web Experience (Originally published in User Experience Magazine, Vol 8, Issue 1, 2009) Explains age-related impairments that impact web use, requirements for web design that enhance the ability of older people to use the web and how existing accessibility guidelines for people with disabilities cover the needs of older users, and future work in this area. Overlapping Needs: People who are Elderly and People with Disabilities Many older people have age-related impairments that can affect how they use the web, such as declining: vision — including reduced contrast sensitivity, color perception, and near-focus, making it difficult to read web pages physical ability — including reduced dexterity and fine motor control, making it difficult to use a mouse and click small targets hearing — including difficulty hearing higher-pitched sounds and separating sounds, making it difficult to hear podcasts and other audio, especially when there is background music cognitive ability — including reduced short-term memory, difficulty concentrating, and being easily distracted, making it difficult to follow navigation and complete online tasks These issues overlap with the accessibility needs of people with disabilities. Thus, websites, applications, and tools that are accessible to people with disabilities are more accessible to older users as well. More About Older User Needs For statistics on the prevalence of age-related impairments and more on how they impact web use, see the Summary of Impact and Prevalence section of the Literature Review Overview. For short story (persona) showing some accessibility issues that an older person can face on the web, see Yun, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss in Stories of Web Users. If you want to learn about older users directly by including real people in your user studies, see Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility. For videos and descriptions of issues that impact people who are elderly and people with disabilities, see Web Accessibility Perspectives. These videos include older users: Customizable Text, Colors with Good Contrast, Notifications and Feedback, Understandable Content, and Large Links, Buttons, and Controls. Guidelines and Other Standards The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international consortium that develops web standards. W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) focuses on making the web accessible to people with disabilities. Standards that are particularly relevant for older users include: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) WCAG materials include guidelines and techniques for making websites and web applications work better for people with disabilities, as well as for older users with accessibility needs due to ageing. User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) UAAG explains how to make web browsers and media players accessible. Browser features are particularly important to older users who have accessibility needs that should be met through browsers instead of requiring additional [assistive technologies](/WAI/planning/involving-users/#at). Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) Authoring tools are used to create web content. Examples of authoring tools are HTML editors and content management systems (CMS). Websites that let users add content &mdash; such as blogs, wikis, photo sharing sites, online forums, and social networking sites &mdash; are also authoring tools. These need to be accessible so that older people can use them. More About Standards For an introduction to accessibility guidelines and other standards, see W3C Accessibility Standards Overview. Specific Guidance on Designing for Older Users A key resource for designers, developers, managers, researchers, and others is Developing Websites for Older People: How Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Applies. It: Introduces how to use WCAG 2.0 to improve the accessibility and usability of websites and web applications for older people. Is organized by user needs and WCAG principles.

    "title": "Overview of “Web Accessibility for Older Users: A Literature Review”",
    "text": "Summary This page introduces a review of literature about web accessibility and older users. It includes summaries of the impact and prevalence of ageing and: hearing loss vision decline physical decline cognitive decline Page Contents Introduction Who the Literature Review is For What is in the Literature Review Summary of Impact and Prevalence Status and Technical Report Format Who Developed the Literature Review Introduction Web Accessibility for Older Users: A Literature Review analyzes guidelines, professional articles, and scientific literature on the requirements of people with web accessibility needs related to ageing. Who the Literature Review is For The Literature Review itself is primarily for researchers and academics. The outcomes of the Literature Review are also being used to: promote accessibility solutions for older web users develop resources for users, industry, and others What is in the Literature Review The Literature Review summarizes: literature and statistics about how older adults use the Web age-related functional limitations requirements of older Web users The bulk of the Literature Review analyzes: existing literature reviews previous approaches to ‘senior friendly’ web guidelines relationship with WAI guidelines training older adults to use information and communications technology (ICT) and the web studies of older web users’ specific disabilities aspects of web design affecting the elderly involving the elderly in web design and development general usability studies involving elderly people A finding of the Literature Review is that existing WAI guidelines address many requirements of older web users. Yet, there is little reference to the WAI guidelines in literature and guidance covering the needs of older Web users. Summary of Impact and Prevalence This section provides summaries from the Literature Review. Ageing and Hearing Loss Impact of hearing loss: Audio can be difficult to discern Background sounds can be difficult to filter out Higher pitch sounds can be missed Prevalence of hearing loss: 47% of people 61 to 80 years experience some hearing loss 93% of people 81+ years experience some hearing loss Hearing starts to decline at around 50 years and affects a person’s ability to hear higher pitched sounds as well as discern the foreground from background audio such as music or other sounds. Some hearing loss is experienced by 47% of people 61 to 80 years and 93% of people over 81 years. Moderate or severe hearing loss or profound deafness is experienced by 20% of people aged 61 - 80 and 75% of people over 80. Ageing and Vision Decline Impact of vision decline: Decreasing ability to focus on near tasks Changing color perception and sensitivity Decreasing contrast sensitivity Prevalence of significant vision lose: 16% of people 65 - 74 years 19% of people 75 - 84 years 46% of people 85+ years Vision decline includes: Decreasing ability to focus on near tasks, including a computer screen Changing color perception and sensitivity - less violet light is registered, making it easier to see reds and yellows than blues and greens, and often making dark blue and black indistinguishable Decreasing contrast sensitivity from pupil shrinkage - resulting in the need for more light and higher contrast (an 80 year old typically has 80% less contrast sensitivity than a 20 year old) Vision decline often starts in a person’s mid-40s. 86% of Australians over 40 require reading glasses to correct for near vision. Significant vision loss (that can’t be corrected) affecting everyday life is estimated to affect 16% of people 65 to 74 years, and 46% of those over 85 years in the UK. Ageing and Physical Decline Impact of physical decline: Motor skill decline can result from many conditions including arthritis, essential tremor, and Parkinson’s Disease: Difficulty using mouse or keyboard Difficulty with clicking small targets Strain from non-ergonomic tasks Prevalence of physical decline: Conditions most commonly reported: Arthritis affects at least 50% of people over 65 Essential tremor affects up to 20% of people over 65 Parkinson’s Disease affects approximately 4% of people over 85 Motor skill decline impacts on dexterity and can result from many conditions, for example arthritis with associated joint stiffening and reduced fine motor control, and essential tremor or Parkinson’s Disease with associated hand trembling, making mouse use difficult or impossible for some and also affecting keyboard use. In particular, older people with physical impairments may have difficulty clicking small links, selecting radio buttons, and using many fly-out or pull-down menus. Arthritis is estimated to affect at least 50% of people over 65; essential tremor (one of many forms of tremor) is estimated to affect up to 5% of those over 40 and up to 20% of people over 65; and Parkinson’s affects around 4% of those over 85. Ageing and Cognitive Decline Impact of cognitive decline: Navigation, comprehension, and task completion can be affected by: Short term memory limitations Difficulty with concentration Distraction from movement or irrelevant material Difficulty coping with information overload Prevalence of cognitive decline: Conditions most commonly reported: Dementia (UK): 1.4% of people 65–69 years 24% of people 85+ years Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is more common: Around 20% of people over 70 years are estimated to experience MCI Cognitive decline is also common, though only dementia and mild cognitive impairment are commonly reported. While Dementia (including Alzheimer’s disease) is experienced by some older people (1.4% of people 65–69 years increasing to 24% of people over 85 years in the UK), forms of mild cognitive impairment (or MCI) are much more common, affecting over 20% of those over 70 years. MCI can result in: Short term memory limitations (which may result in a person forgetting the purpose of a website visit if they lose orientation on the site) Concentration and distraction issues (consider the volume of information on some pages, and the multiple animated advertisements that are sometimes present) Status and Technical Report Format The Literature Review was conducted in 2008. We do not currently plan to update it. Most of the information is still relevant. The Literature Review follows the W3C format for technical reports that includes several sections at the beginning: links to different versions, editors, copyright, abstract, and status. Who Developed the Literature Review The Literature Review was developed by the Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG), with support of the WAI-AGE Project.",

More details are in About WAI IG below. Other Interest Group Pages: Charter Discussion E-mail List Archives Announcements E-mail List Archives Mailing Lists There are two mailing lists: Announcements list (public-wai-announce) — for WAI announcements only. Discussion list (w3c-wai-ig) — for WAI announcements and public discussion. All e-mails sent to the Announcements list will also go to this Discussion list, so you don’t need to subscribe to both lists. If you want to send messages to the list, you must send them from an e-mail address that is subscribed to the list. Details are below. Announcements List - Subscribing and Unsubscribing To subscribe, send e-mail to public-wai-announce-request@w3.org with subject: “subscribe”. To unsubscribe, send e-mail to public-wai-announce-request@w3.org with subject: “unsubscribe”. You can also see the Announcements List Archives. Using the Discussion List Discussion List Archives are useful for searching for past messages and getting a feel for the list. E-mail messages should contribute to a comfortable, constructive exchange of ideas to advance web accessibility. Before you write an e-mail, think about how it will come across to the hundreds of people around the world who are on the list. Be respectful. Be positive. Be open to different perspectives. Provide constructive information. Focus on developing solutions, rather than just complaining. Avoid personal attacks, naming calling, and such. Explain the issue clearly. Provide sufficient background information. Make sure e-mails are related web accessibility and are appropriate for the WAI IG list. If you have questions about whether or not a message is appropriate for the WAI IG list, contact Shawn. When your comments are not useful for the entire list, reply off-list — that is, reply directly to the sender and do not send the message to the list. No soliciting. Formatting messages: Use a Subject line that describes the topic well. If you change topics, change the Subject. This is usually handled as follows: New Topic XYZ [was: Old Topic] Keep your reply comments near the top of a message, and only quote essential parts of a previous message at the top — so there are few quote markings for readers to wade through. If you use a vacation auto-responder, exclude responses to mail with w3c-wai-ig@w3.org in any header. Send any questions about the WAI IG mailing list to shawn@w3.org, not to the whole list. Subscribing and Unsubscribing to the Discussion List To subscribe to the list, send e-mail to w3c-wai-ig-request@w3.org with subject: “subscribe”. To unsubscribe from the list, send e-mail to w3c-wai-ig-request@w3.org with subject: “unsubscribe”. Please note: The subscription e-mail addresses are different from the e-mail address to send an e-mail message, which is in the next section. To subscribe to the email digest with compiled messages, send e-mail to w3c-wai-ig-d-request@w3.org with “subscribe” as the subject. To unsubscribe from the digest, send e-mail to w3c-wai-ig-d-request@w3.org with “unsubscribe” as the subject. Sending Messages to the Discussion List To send a message to the list, first subscribe to the list (instructions above), then send your message to w3c-wai-ig@w3.org The first time you send a message to a public W3C mailing list, you will get a reply e-mail asking if you will give permission for your message to be distributed to the list and thus go into the public archive. There is an option to do this once and then you don’t have to do it again in the future.

You can submit ideas for new or updated techniques. There is a form for submitting WCAG 2.0 Techniques. To submit techniques for other guidelines, contact the Working Group’s Team Contact. Participating in Interest Groups The WAI Interest Group (WAI IG) is for general discussion and feedback on all areas of WAI’s work. Most of the interaction within WAI IG is through the public mailing list. Participating in Working Groups Anyone can join a WAI Working Group public mailing list, or read the public list archives. There are specific criteria for formally joining Working Groups, including requirements for participation and contribution. See the Working Group pages below to find what group best fits your interests, and to get information on participation and links to the mailing list archives. ARIA Working Group develops a suite of Accessible Rich Internet Applications resources, and accessible APIs and mappings. Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group reviews and comments on support for accessibility throughout W3C’s other working groups. Education and Outreach Working Group develops awareness, training, and implementation resources supporting Web accessibility. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group develops guidelines for Web pages, Web applications, and other Web content. Sponsoring WAI WAI’s work is supported in part by sponsorship from industry, disability, and government organizations interested in contributing to WAI’s efforts to make the Web more accessible. Please see the list of current sponsors on the WAI home page, and Sponsoring WAI for more information on WAI sponsorship. Promoting and Implementing Web Accessibility Promoting Awareness Tell people about WAI and web accessibility. Link to WAI’s home page and other relevant resources, including Finding Your WAI (shortened link: bit.ly/yourWAI). Cover web accessibility in presentations and training to web developers, designers, managers, and others. Put a WCAG logo on your website if it meets WCAG 2.0. Implementing Guidelines Use the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) documents to help make your website accessible. If you develop authoring tools—any software or service that people use to create or modify Web content, including content management systems—implement the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG). If you develop Web browsers, media players, assistive technologies, or other user agents—implement the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG). Encouraging Accessibility Encourage authoring tools to meet ATAG by directly contacting vendors and requesting increased accessibility support in future versions, and by purchasing tools that provide the best support for accessibility. Encourage Web browsers, media players, assistive technologies, and other user agents to meet UAAG. Encourage organizations to adopt an accessibility policy for their organization that defines their commitment to Web accessibility. Encourage websites to be accessible, for example, provide feedback on inaccessible websites and inaccessible Web products carefully; it is usually more productive to start with a positive encouraging tone, rather than a negative critical tone.",

About 55 rules were developed through the project so far, with another 15 to follow this year. This is the result of project deliverables D1.1, D1.2, and D1.3, which are continually developed through the W3C ACT Rules Community Group (previously Auto-WCAG Community Group, which has been renamed). Prototype large-scale monitoring Includes open source tool to visualize and compare accessibility test results gathered from different sources, including conformance evaluation reports and accessibility statements. It uses the Open Format for Accessibility Test Results developed by the project as the backbone for open linked data on accessibility. Norwegian national observatory Includes running and documenting Pilot Monitoring in accordance with the EU Web Accessibility Directive (WAD), as well as documenting the local WCAG Interpretion and ACT Rules mappings. These reports provide practical insights on an example national monitoring initiative with many key take-aways for the project and beyond. Portuguese national observatory Includes processing test results from multiple tools that provide output in the open format developed by the project (see corresponding project deliverable listed below). These tools include the open source engines from Siteimprove, Deque, and University of Lisbon developed through the project. These implement ACT Rules to provide consistent results. Updated WCAG-EM Report Tool Includes all the Success Criteria from WCAG 2.0 and 2.1, as well as user-interface improvements to support the selection between these two standards. This version also includes a new “Import” functionality to allow importing of test results, for example from automated testing tools. Further improvements are currently in planning. Developing an Accessibility Statement Includes guidance on how to develop accessibility statements for websites, mobile applications, and other digital content, as well as a free and open source accessibility statements generator tool. More information in the blog post How to Create Accessibility Statements. Open Format for Accessibility Test Results Includes the definition of an open data format to express accessibility test results. It is a JSON-LD 1.0 serialization of the EARL 1.0 Schema, and is implemented by the open source Alfa and aXe Reporter testing engines. Project Deliverables Development of Test Rules D1.1: Development of Test Rules — development of accessibility conformance test rules according to the ACT Rules Format 1.0 standard from W3C. D1.2: Implementation of Test Rules — implementation of the test rules developed by the project in at least two open source testing engines, Alfa and aXe Core. D1.3: Validation of Test Rules — validate and refine test rules developed by the project, to meet the requirements for authoritative ACT Rules. Deployment of Test Rules D2.1: Open Format for Test Results — develop open format built on Evaluation and Report Language (EARL) and Test Case Description Language (TCDL). D2.2: Applying to Portuguese Observatory — applying the test rules and tooling developed by the project in the Portuguese national observatory. D2.3: Applying to Norwegian Observatory — running Pilot Monitoring and documenting WCAG Interpretion for the Norwegian national observatory. Integration of Test Rules D3.1: Accessibility Statement Generator — open source tool, to assist help create accessibility statements. D3.2: Extended Accessibility Report Tool — extending the WCAG-EM Report Tool with functionality to import fully- and semi-automated test results.

    "title": "Captions from ACT Rules for Manual Web Accessibility Evaluation Methodologies – Online Symposium, 14 March 2018",
    "text": "Sponsors This online symposium was organized with support of the WAI-Tools Project, funded by the European Commission Meeting Record This is the meeting record from the online symposium on ACT Rules for Manual Web Accessibility Evaluation Methodologies, held on 14 March 2018. Page Contents Introduction to ACT Questions from the Survey Questions from the Floor Wrap-up and Closing Introduction to ACT Shadi Abou-Zahra: Welcome, everyone, to the online symposium on ACT rules for manual web accessibility evaluation methodologies. As a reminder, first of all, you should have a link to the slides in the latest e-mail so you can follow these on your computer. We are also showing them, sharing the screen. I hope this is working for most of you who are joining using the online web conferencing system. If you are dialling in, please have a look at the slides separately. Before we dig in to the details just to put in context the long road until where we are today, and that’s important just to put some things in context, some of these are relevant today. So some of this work on conformance testing started really long ago. It is as old as WCAG 1, maybe even before that when the Trace guidelines emerged. Some people were thinking about tooling and evaluation schemes and ways to test for these guidelines, for these requirements. So there was a lot of work early on by Len Kadsay who unfortunately passed away, Wendy Chishom and many others who wrote the techniques for accessibility evaluation and repair tools. Flowed in to development of WCAG 2.0 to make it testable. And if people remember the techniques themselves and the failures, they have some small procedures in there. So at least intent and idea was there. For quite awhile there was evaluation and repair tools working at W3C and that was focusing specifically on working with evaluation tool developers and looking at ways to improve automation and tool support, but also the consistency of evaluation and repair. And it was a lot of work there. It was also a lot of generations of different kinds of accessibility test tools and manual methodologies that emerged over the years and how the entire industry here of testing basically matured over the years as we went along. An important point I think is the so called WAB Cluster. It stands for Web Accessibility Benchmarking. And this was actually three projects funded by the European Commission that were asked to put together the so called Unified Web Evaluation Methodology, UWEM. We are going to look at that in the next slide in a bit more detail, but it is actually one of the important attempts to try to have a coordinated and aligned methodology for testing web content. And this was actually within these three projects together, there were maybe 24 European organizations in there and there was a lot of work put in to try to make that happen. And also one of the important things we are going to look at later is test samples for WCAG 2.0. One of the projects in this cluster, BenToWeb, and we have people on this project on the call today. So they may be clarifying some things. But those test samples are examples of good and bad content which were to test evaluation deals. So there was a lot of work put in to that and this is actually coming back in the ACT work through the idea of test cases. And we are going to look at that a little bit later on. A lot of the work that has happened in the past has helped inform our latest approach, our latest attempt and also some of the work invested in the past is stuff that we can take up on and build on for the new work that we are talking about here. Let me talk just a little bit about the Unified Web Evaluation Methodology. And this was an important step to try to align different practices that were going on in different European countries and to try to harmonize the approaches between them. In my view one of the challenges with that UWEM was it was trying to do many things at the same time. It was trying to be large scale monitoring. So having here an approach for large scale monitoring and the issue with large scale monitoring you are looking more for indicators rather than quality. You are not really looking at the specific state of a website, but you are trying to kind of have an idea how accessible is it and trying to relate the degrees of accessibility among different websites or different regions and so on. So this you kind of sacrifice a lot of the quality for scalability when you are doing such large scale. At the same time the UWEM was also trying to be a process for evaluating websites, qualitative to the evaluation for improvement. Somebody who wants to check their own website and see where they perform good, where they perform bad and what they need to fix. So the classical evaluation where people look at the site in detail to try to improve it. And last but not least there was also another attempt here on certification. And in certification again you have a slightly different view on evaluation where you are primarily looking for problems, just looking for issues, just trying to confirm whether no issues are found, you are not really trying to exhaustively find all types of issues or all issues because, you know, typically in certification you don’t even suggest the changes or the improvements. You just look for failures. And if there are none, then you issue the certificate. And if there are issues then you ask people to revisit their website. So and again all these three approaches are important for accessibility. But trying to combine them in one is really a challenge. I think each of these needs its own methodology and its own approach to accomplish, even if they are based on the same tests. And this is where this work comes in to try to have a basis tests that are common that can be used in different kinds of methodologies and scenarios. Another issue with UWEM is that it was based on WCAG 1 and we all know that WCAG 1 had a lot of difficulties with testability. Things like saying provide sufficient contrast was a big issue because it is not a testable statement. You don’t know how sufficient it is. And so that created a problem. So these were some of the issues of why UWEM had difficulty, but at the same time I think also during that stage there was not a lot of interest from I think particularly some of the industry organizations but many others as well to basically share, have a common understanding of testing. Many people felt that how they test a website and these checks are their assets, their know how and that they need to keep this to themselves because it is really how they differentiate themselves from their competitors or from the others or they invested so much in work that they don’t want to give it up. So these were some of the issues at the time that made it very difficult to really get people together and agree on one common approach. Moving on to slide No. 6 is really looking at the benefits of harmonization or the impact of fragmentation. What happens when people continue that whole process and have different evaluation results essentially, different understanding of accessibility, how they check something. And that really causes a lot of confusion among everyone involved in the development life cycle. And by developers here I mean the designers, front end, back end, the coders, the testers and so on. Really all the developers here but also suppliers to organizations. This happens very often. You are trying to plug in maybe something, some template or some tool, a player or something like that and that doesn’t meet your understanding of the requirements because the suppliers maybe have a different understanding of the accessibility requirements. And also third party evaluations when you are doing third party evaluations and there are differences. And that causes a lot of wasted effort. And we don’t have that many resources to spend in accessibility really to have duplicate efforts and these kinds of differences amongst us and in some cases actually it even causes loss of contracts. So when you are purchasing a website and then you run a tool over it or you do your testing, and you say hmmm, that’s not accessible and the other person says no, it is, according to there. And so, you know, maybe even lose contracts, but in any case a lot of wasted efforts and resources that are very rare and that we need to be careful of. But more importantly it reduces the credibility of accessibility for the entire field. It hurts us to have these differences in interpretation. And this is in the last years one of the big changes that is happening which is many more people are coming to the understanding including tool developers who for years and years were trying to distinguish themselves based on their testing interpretations are coming around to the conclusion that by having a more common understanding and reliability of how tools and methodologies perform the more basically the stronger the market is for everyone and the more benefits we all have from that. And there is still a lot of ways to differentiate also between methodologies. I’ll get in to that a little bit later. But the idea here is there should be different types of methodologies. Maybe they are going to be more educational. This is very often in say the educational sector or in the public sector where you are trying to get people to do evaluations who are not regularly accessibility experts but need to be able to check some of the content. And so these people need maybe very educational or basic methodologies that have a lot of explanation and hand holding and guidance. Now in other areas, let’s say in methodology for a certification authority where the primary users are accessibility experts who need to know what they need to check. And for them maybe such an educational methodology would be too verbose and would be too distracting and they want to have more, you know, exact information about what they need to test and that’s it. And they will just go through that. So there are different ways or different kinds of methodology that each have their place and the distinguishing factors between methodologies and tools should not be based on the interpretation of the results but on other factors. For tools there are things like the performance of tools and how well they fit in to your development process and many other things where tool makers can actually differentiate themselves. Also the coverage, how many tests they cover and so on. But it shouldn’t really be on interpretation. And so I think this is a major point here that as I said a lot of in the community is actually coming to that conclusion and so this has been a major step that led to this latest work on ACT, Accessibility Conformance Testing. Now meanwhile, on slide 7, while this was going on so to say in the evaluation area we also had the release of WCAG 2, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, 2.0 in 2008 which as most of you will know has more testable requirements than WCAG 1 had. Also this notion of techniques and failures I think is very important. The idea is that you can extend, provide more detail as you go along as you find out things, as new technologies emerge. We saw the changes of HTML4 to HTML5, introduction of WAI ARIA and some of this WAI ARIA being integrated in to HTML5. Technology changes very quickly. And by having this idea that you can have techniques and failures that adapt to the current situation, the current technological situation but that the requirements themselves are more stable. This has proven to be really useful and something also where we as testers can come in and adhere to the testing aspects. So most of the time here we are looking at failures. A lot of the checks that we are talking about actually map to failures that the content does not meet. Also one of the important things about WCAG 2 is that since its release there has been much more international harmonization. Back then with WCAG 1 or several years ago there were many more derivatives of WCAG 1.0. The U.S. was different than Europe or the European Commission was saying. The individual European Member States have had different standards. Also around the world there were yet more different interpretations of WCAG 1 mixtures between WCAG 1 and WCAG 2. And so the situation was much more dire. It is not perfect yet. There are still issues and differences between countries. But there is certainly much more harmonization meanwhile which I think is a good situation to be in to know that these testing work we are doing would cover a much broader area, much broader market. So this strengthens our case and helps the work that we are doing. Also meanwhile there is Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology, WCAG EM. It is actually yet another different type of methodology. It doesn’t go in to the details of how to check individual requirements, but through the process of how to evaluate a website because WCAG focuses really on pages, on individual pages more. And this is a non-normative specification. So this is not a W3C standard, it is a so called Working Group Note that explains how to check a website, how to select individual pages from a website. So they are representative and so on. So that you can get to a useful answer at the end when you have done that of how accessible a website is. And meanwhile also there is a so called Auto-WCAG Community Group and I need to explain that a little bit. At W3C we have Working Groups which are established by the W3C membership to create a standard or a specification. Whereas a Community Group anybody can create, and anybody can get work started there. So this is kind of pre-standardization, what we call incubation. And when enough community interest in there or something really proves to be coming along then the membership may decide to make that actually in to a Working Group. This is actually how a lot of this latest work on Accessibility Conformance Testing started up. There was yet again another European funded project called EIII project. This project is one of the descendants of the WAB Cluster. Their focus here was on more the large scale monitoring of websites in regions. So what they were trying to do is basically create yet again a set of tests which they can run across sites, automated tests so they can run across sites to get an idea of how accessible they are. Instead of just doing that work within the project itself, they started the community group and actually also on the call today is Wilco Fiers who is the co-facilitator of that work today at W3C. They basically started to work in the open in this community group. And it started to gather momentum. People started to join that group. Started to discuss, started to exchange and again it was focused really on automated testing. Maybe in hindsight that name is a bit misleading because it has the automation kind of connotation whereas meanwhile we broaden the work much more. But anyway, that was really a kickstart in terms of having here something from the community where we could see that there is much more interest around this, around harmonizing than we had in the past, in the years before where people were really not as keen on having a common interpretation. So that takes us to slide 8, the creation of the Accessibility Conformance Testing work within W3C. As I said, this Auto-WCAG group and incubation work started to gather sufficient critical mass and there was enough membership within W3C to get that work started, a task force was created. This is W3C terminology, but basically a task force is a subgroup of a working group. So directly within the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group which is developing the accessibility guidelines. So developing WCAG. Directly embedded in there is this task force that’s tasked with Accessibility Conformance Testing. As I mentioned earlier, the co-facilitator here is not only Wilco Fiers but also Mary Jo Mueller from IBM who is also on the call today. These are the facilitators of the group but we have had a lot of involvement from other organizations, from Siteimprove, from the Daisy Consortium where they are looking at digital publishing, from Level Access. University of Illinois was participating and several others. I’m sorry that I’m forgetting some. And the mission of this task force is to develop three distinct things. First is the so called ACT Rules Format. The idea being here that if we want people to share their test rules and contribute them we need a common way of writing down these rules so that we can actually share them. So we can actually have people contributing these test rules. Another piece here to develop by the group is the ACT Review Process. So once somebody has contributed a rule, what should be the process from that contribution to make it in to a formal, a vetted and approved rule? And last but not least is actually those rules that get vetted and reviewed and approved to collect them and provide an open repository of such rules that people can take and use in their methodologies or in their test tools. All these pieces are in development. All these things are still in draft. So there is a lot of opportunity here to comment and provide input. A lot of moving pieces but it is firming up. And next on slide 9 maybe that gives hopefully a bit of an overview of how these things, how these pieces fit together. In the very bottom of this diagram is the ACT Rules Format. Again this is the common format of how you write down such rules and so that you can share them in to the repository and there can be different sources here. We have commitments from several different organizations. The commitment that they will be sharing rules. We also, since November 2017, have an EC funded project called the WAI-Tools Project supporting this work. Specifically this presentation today, this symposium is organized by this WAI-Tools Project. And I’ll mention more at the end about that. So we have several contributors here in order to accelerate the work. These different sources will be contributing ACT rules. And then on the left hand side is this vertical bar and that represents the ACT Review Process. That really takes it from the source to the review and vetting process in to the rules repository which already has implementations. So part of this review process is that you need to demonstrate implementation of these rules in order for them to be adopted in to the rules repository. And then we can have further implementations. The word implementation here applies to not only test tools but also to manual methodologies. That’s an important aspect here. That ACT Rules themselves are not intended to be used directly by evaluators. These are not what you actually go and test a website with, but these get interpreted in to a test tool or in to a methodology. Because you have the different flavors of methodologies and different flavors of tools. So the ACT Rules are really addressed more to people developing tools and developing methodologies rather than directly at the people carrying out evaluations. These implementations, these tools and methodologies are used by the evaluators. The hope here is that we have more consistent results between these different evaluations. Regardless which methodology you use or which tool you use you have more consistent results at the end. That’s the overall goal. Moving on to slide No. 10, I should mention, going in to the individual pieces here of this diagram is the ACT Rules Format, 1.0. This is a working draft which we have just published another version of on the 8th of March. Just a few days ago. The review period goes until 5th of April. So this is your opportunity to comment. I will remind you of this later on in the discussion. Really looking for feedback here, your input. It is starting to firm up. We hope that our next draft will be the last working draft and then we will be going in to the next level of maturity at W3C. And so we are making progress here. But we do need your input and actually specifically the purpose of this symposium today is to introduce most of you who, from seeing your responses, are involved in manual evaluation, manual testing. So we would like to know from people developing manual methodologies how does this really fit with, what you are trying to do with your development of methodologies and your development of test rules. So let’s have a look at the outline. These are the pieces on slide No. 11 that this rules format specifies, needs to be in an ACT Rule. First of all, a unique identifier. Every rule needs to have a unique identifier, descriptive title, and a description. The accessibility requirements that it maps to, things like which success criteria of WCAG does this address. Some limitations, assumptions or exceptions, accessibility support. Aspects under test. This is relevant for tools as well. So you are looking at the DOM tree. Are you looking at the direct HTTP response that you get from the server? Are you looking at the code or the rendered code? What is it that you are actually testing on the content and providing that information is really important. Also a very important concept and we are going to be talking about that in a little bit more detail in just a bit is the applicability and expectations. When we first started this work a lot of this was based on so called steps. Testing steps. Do this first; do this second; do this third. The issue with that is that it doesn’t map well to things like let’s say tools or approaches that are doing this, implementing this differently. Let’s say Artificial Intelligence or other types of testing that do not really have this procedural approach but looking more at what is it that I need to test. The concept of a rule group, of combining different rules together to get to a common test, to test particular requirements and finally test cases. And test cases that I have said much earlier those test samples. Test cases are examples of content that meet this rule and content that doesn’t. And that’s really, really important. This is how you check your implementation. Whether your implementation is a test tool or a methodology. This is how you check if you have the correct interpretation of the rule or not. Let’s look at a few examples just to make this a little bit more concrete. On slide 12. I’ll switch over to a browser. The first one we will be looking at is the ACT R2, which is a rule that we have published along with the rules format just to demonstrate how such rules would look like. This rule is called proper use of ARIA described by. What you are trying to check here is whether ARIA described by has been used properly or not. And what you have is the accessibility requirement, is which success criteria this really maps to and in this cases is success criteria 1.1.1 which is non-text content. You then have a description and some background, and some of the WCAG techniques and failures that it maps to. Some of the assumptions that you are making here in order to test. There are certain assumptions. What I talked about the aspects of the test, so in this case you are testing the DOM tree and the CSS styling. These things are defined in the rules format. Then the really important piece that I wanted to show is the applicability and the expectation. The applicability part you describe as precisely as possible the specific aspects that this rule applies to. So in this case it is an element with the semantic role of image that has a non-empty ARIA described by attribute. And it goes on. This is really what is applicable to. It makes it very specific what it is applicable to. And we moved away from what we previously had as things like CSS selectors or things to try to codify this. Because it has too many limitations and things that restrict the implementations, especially when we get in to things that are more manual or not fully automatible. Then you have the bunch of expectations which all need to be applied to this applicability in order for this test procedure to be checked. So, for instance, the first one is that each target element of this ARIA described by has a direct identifier. This is the first expectation. The second expectation, first of all, you have to fulfill the first expectation but also this described by ARIA attribute. So you write down the expectations of what you need to achieve. Now what you don’t do is you don’t say which tool you should use to do this or how to do it in a browser or so again this is not directly geared to the evaluators themselves but people who are going to take that and implement it in either a testing methodology. One could be more verbose or the other more educational, the other more technical. There could be different flavors of these methodologies, but also for tools. Also by writing it down like this you could have more tool supports. Even if this rule may not be fully automatible maybe tools can do different parts of these checks. For instance, to check that certain attributes exist, a tool can do that. But you may need to point out to the tool or support the tool to understand what the references are. By writing down the exact testing, first of all, we achieve a more common understanding and more consistency in the results but also allow for more tool support to take place, to have more scalability basically. Moving down in the rule, again these validation tests, these are the test cases that’s really important. Here you have some test cases and some examples of code that should pass. Some that are expected to fail. And some that are expected to be not applicable. That’s what’s your result is. When you run your methodology or you run your tool on these test cases, that’s the results that you should be expecting. I want to also show just two other rules that are in development because they are more related to manual testing. This is just an early draft. You can see from GitHub it is still only an issue. It is not even a so called pull request yet. It is the earlier stage of development. I am looking now at the keyboard trap R1 which is in the slides, the URL with issue 67 at the end. This one actually we have been working on that through the WAI-Tools Project. This is actually derived from the methodology that is used by the Norwegian Government agency called Difi who are also on the call today. They have a check in checking the keyboard trap. In their methodology they lead the evaluator from one step to the other what they need to do. And we extracted from that the actual essence of the check. The applicability and expectation. While doing that we saw that we need to actually separate it in to two subrules, R1 and R2. This R1 only checks that you can actually move away from the element. Many people don’t remember the success criterion of that part. The success criterion for keyboard trap, something along the lines that you can move away using standard keyboard controls. That you can move away from an element that you have tabbed in to or moved in to using the standard keys. By the way, standard keys is not defined in the guidelines. Or the user is informed about how to move away. So this or there, this needed a second rule to map that. This first rule R1 checks the first part of the requirement, which is if you can move in to an element you can actually move out of the element again. We have put an initial definition of what these standard keys are and these are the escape key, tab key, shift tab and enter key. This will be for discussion but the idea here we started to define this more specifically. What does it mean to move out using standard keys which is not really specified in WCAG at this moment. And then R2, as I said earlier R2 covers that or part of that success criterion of that requirement which is that help information is available. There are certain expectations again mapped in to how help information can be made available if you cannot use these standard keys. This is what we call a rule group. You have to combine in order to check the success criteria. There are two different kinds of subchecks in there or two atomic pieces. These were some examples of these ACT rules to give you an idea of how these ACT Rules look like. The important part here is that this is really geared towards developers of methodologies, not directly at evaluators. Then, what I have mentioned earlier, is the ACT Review Process. We saw those two rules, actually three rules but, you know, two sets and one looked finished. We just wanted to show the first one with the ACT R2, we wanted to show how it would look like when it is done, when it has completed this entire review process. The keyboard ones we have looked at most recently which is step 1 which is the creation stage. Step 2 is the validation stage which you make sure you have the test cases and in the right format. So, for instance, these keyboard tests right now they don’t have all the test cases that they should have. That’s why they are still considered in step 1. When they have all test cases and all pieces that they need, then they would then pass the validation stage. Then comes the verification stage where people debate and discuss. For instance, this definition that we have of what standard keys are. Somebody may challenge that or maybe somebody will request that another key combination get added. These are different kinds of things that need to get agreed on. Step 4 is the implementation of these rules. Every rule needs to have at least two independent implementations before it can even be considered by the Working Group for acceptance. This is how we try to do this work in the community process, outside the Working Group, so that we are more scalable. We do that work through community development and demonstrate that these rules are broadly accepted and agreed on, and there are implementations for them. Step 5 is put in brackets because it is not really a step. This is actually an ongoing thing, the maintenance. At any time there could be new technologies, any reason why you would need to change a rule or maybe deprecate it or maybe there was a bug in it or things like this. There is this maintenance aspect in this review process. Last but not least, when there is acceptance and sufficient consensus, it may get accepted by the Working Group in to the ACT Rules repository as a completed ACT Rule that is ready for broader use. Moving on to slide No. 14, we have the same diagram again that we had earlier. Hopefully this will actually make a little bit more sense now, this diagram. Again, at the very bottom is ACT Rules Format which is the basis, defines what belongs in rules and how these rules should look like and this is out for draft. We are asking for your input on this and also review process, also this is for discussion. This also something we would like to have input on. On the side it is written ACT Task Force. This ACT Rules Format is what is standardized and developed by the W3C Working Group. The rules contribution and the rules review and processing really happens in a community group outside the W3C. Right now it is the Auto-WCAG community group. That’s the community group that we have. But there is no reason not to have others. For instance, there could be a community group focusing only on rules for digital publishing let’s say or we were for a while debating whether we needed to have a manual-WCAG group or have both in the same group side by side which is kind of what we are leaning in to. The layer above that is implementations. We start to have implementation already during the review process. We hope when you release rules in to repository that will get more implementations of this. Last but not least at the very top are the evaluators who use the implementations to come to a conclusion. Let’s just continue to slide No. 15. I want to emphasize the auto-WCAG group, since it is a community group, is open to anyone who wants to participate. We do ask you do get involved if you want to create rules, if you want to contribute. For instance, if you have ideas on the keyboard rule that’s being developed, well, chime in. Put in your comments. Put in your issues. Let us know what your thoughts are, or if you want to implement these rules and we will have a look at these repositories in a bit. The URL is there but I’ll also show you later on. Questions from the Survey Shadi Abou-Zahra: I’ll start by looking at some questions that we got from the survey. Unfortunately there were not as many as we were hoping. Many of you actually it seemed like wanted to know more about the ACT work and what it is which is why we have kind of switched more to introductory mode and to have more kind of background explanation. There were some interesting questions and I wanted to cover some of these. So some of the questions revolved around the idea of, you know, accessibility evaluation cannot be completely formalized or you cannot have, you know, to what degree can you make it so mechanical. One comment was even saying accessibility will get boring if everything was completely formalized and mechanical. Absolutely. There are key limitations. There are many things that cannot be tested automatically or even formalized, but what we are trying to do here is to document what we already know. To get agreement on some of the things like keyboard trap or things like headings hierarchy. There are several parts I think in WCAG where we can just document having a common understanding of and move on. There will be actually quite a couple of things still open. The next question actually also relates to that very much is kind of, you know, we are looking here at ACT Rules on an element level or very atomic level of issues. But very often issues are kind of in combination or in context. There is a big picture, what if you are dealing with an entire component rather than bits and pieces. That’s another limitation of this ACT work. This is another thing where evaluators will probably need to bring things together. Aggregate some thoughts like, you know, this keyboard thing is happening on navigation or versus it is happening somewhere else. What is the failure here. That’s the issue. There aren’t many things here that ACT does not fully address, but at least again we would have common understanding for some of these atomic level things. Some other questions where well, there is limited set here in repository. Not a lot to see. That is yes, just, you know, chicken or egg. We are just starting to develop some of these things. We do hope that we will see the commitments from some organizations. We have this European funded project that will support the development of these rules. We hope that in the next while once these pieces start firming up, that we will see the development of more rules here and this repository will get fuller as we go along. Some of the other questions that I liked about the usability of these ACT Rules. I would like to filter them. I would like to have them integrated with other resources. I would like to be able to use them more directly as a developer. This is also something that we are looking in to. I mentioned earlier we have the WCAG EM, evaluation methodology. We have the How To Meet WCAG 2 Quick Reference Guide. So there are several bits and pieces where we can tie together these things and have these rules appear in these tools and resources that the evaluators use more directly. Have them appear there, but first we need to have this repository kind of more rules in order to start connecting some of these thoughts. Let’s see, what else? What is out of scope of ACT? That’s a really great question. There are a lot of things that are out of scope. We talked about the limitations, just a little bit earlier. ACT really tests on an atomic level, on a very detailed level. It misses out a lot on the kind of grand scheme of things. More importantly ACT, one of the things that we really tried to or one of our important limitations is that we will not try in any way to redefine the requirements of. So that’s really important. We are not trying to extend or change or modify the requirements of a Working Group. That’s completely out of scope to try to define new requirements here. There were a few others but I think I will go to the queue and I will actually start opening up and have some discussion. If people don’t get on the speaker queue, then I will actually maybe call on some people. Wilco and Mary Jo, can I ask you both to unmute and if you wanted to add anything or to respond to some of the questions. Questions from the Floor Wilco Fiers: So to anybody who is not familiar, I’m Wilco. I work for Deque Systems. Thank you, Shadi, for putting this all together and for the presentation. It has been very helpful. The thing I want to emphasize most again is what I’m hoping to accomplish with this work is that we can start to harmonize our efforts. There is a lot of work going on in a lot of different organizations. And we are duplicate on a lot of stuff. So and all of that just means not just extra work. It means that differences are going to arise. People are going to see these differences. People are going to be confused about why does organization A say one thing and organization B say a different thing. And that costs us things. We lose people if they start getting confused about accessibility and really getting a clear message helps all of us. So that I think that’s really the essence of what I’m trying to get at, what I am hoping to get at with this kind of work. Mary Jo Mueller: I’m Mary Jo Mueller and I’m with IBM. I am the accessibility programs manager. I think that pretty much everything has been said about what our real ultimate goals are. It is important that there is a very consistent resulting message with tools doing testing. That they kind of agree upon their results. And then there is no questions that arise as far as who is right or what is exactly right with the test for accessibility barriers, what are the real accessibility barriers. And we get a nice consistent way to test for conformance which we need to report for our products. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Okay. Thank you both. So let’s see, some questions from the floor. So, first of all, Mark asks what does failure of a rule mean. Does it mean that a certain particular technique does not meet the success criteria or that the success criteria is violated. So the design of ACT Rules goes directly to success criteria. We don’t test techniques. But we actually test directly for the success criteria. So a rule maps to a failure. So basically you could think of it as a more elaborate failure. There are existing WCAG failures but we need more. Failures are sometimes also more general, like failure to provide text alternative or something general. We are breaking down these failure conditions in to more atomic and more specific bits and pieces, but if there is a failure of a rule, then actually that would map directly to a failure of at least a success criteria. Sometimes it may map to more than one success criteria. Wendy asks have we looked at the results format at the Sirus oasis. Yes. We are planning to continue using EARL which Wendy, you have been involved in creating. I would be interested to hear more of your thoughts, whether you think that there is a particular benefit of Sirus. We start to use JSON realization of EARL. Wendy Chisholm: My name is Wendy Chishom. Nice to see the reference there. Thank you. Some of our tools are not accessibility tools. And so we are looking for some formats so we can use between policy areas and looking for something that is more generic and so no decisions have been made. We are looking at some formats right now, Sirus, that is something that has been talked about recently. I am curious if others feel that also or if EARL is broad enough. One of the issues that we are having and it is funny, I haven’t looked at EARL in a while and I need to go back and look at it again, Sirus doesn’t have the breadth of fields that we are capturing, screen shots. Something we are investigating now. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Okay. Would love to hear more of your thoughts. I think GitHub, there is already this JSON realization of the role, trying to use I think we will take back that idea of revisiting Sirus and seeing if there are any particular things that it provides or benefits over EARL, but if you have any thoughts, let’s each look at what we haven’t looked at in awhile and see if we can come up with anything. Wendy Chisholm: Yes, if you have done a gap analysis or planning to, that would be interesting. Shadi Abou-Zahra: I will take a look. Next question is from Brian. Brian, do you want to introduce your question yourself? Brian Bors: I’m Brian. I work for the Accessibility Foundation. I’m part of the European projects. And we are dedicated to making these rules. And I was interested in how such a manual implementation of a rule would look like and automated implementation would be a tool that actually tests this rule, that have bound and manual implementation would look like. For us as an organization stating yes, we use this rule. Would that be enough or would you have to provide a few steps that our evaluators are following? Shadi Abou-Zahra: That’s a very important question. So with implementation in order to verify that there are implementations it would need to be publicly documented. And there are a few, there is the I mentioned earlier the Norwegian indicators by the Norwegian Government agency which are on GitHub and have done the work of translating them in to English. I don’t know if anybody from Difi wants to say something on that. There is also the Trusted Tester methodology which is publicly documented which you can have a look at and shows how to follow certain steps in order to check requirements. And they actually provide additional information, like which tools to use and which widgets or browsers. What to do in the browser to test a certain thing. And again I wonder if anybody from Trusted Tester wants to say any more on this. There is also the French RGAA which is also publicly documented on GitHub. This is the French Government approach for the same thing. And this is actually one of the things that we hope that we will get convergence between all these different approaches that are trying to do the same thing which is how to check something. Of course, again they could have their own flavors. So some are like in Excel sheets where they give you the step by step. And you have to answer a question first. And then based on that answer, you know, another kind of question pops up. And it is more like wizard kind of interface. Others could be maybe more just checklist oriented and so on. So I don’t know if that answers your question, but this is how implementation would look like. It would not be just taking these rules but really how you explain to a tester how they do that. Again this could be more technical. Or it could be more educational. Brian Bors: So like an instruction manual for a tester? Shadi Abou-Zahra: Yeah, yeah. Again this instructional manual can be more educational if you are dealing with public sector bodies who, you know, are not the expert. It could be more technical if you are using that in your organization. And you are addressing more the QA testers. I think this manuals would look very different from one to the other. Brian Bors: Yes. That answers my question. Thank you. Shadi Abou-Zahra: All right. And Kathy writes on IRC just related to that the trusted tester is being updated now to include WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA and still in progress. Wilco Fiers: Right. Just real brief. I wanted to add that just to avoid confusion, the rules format is not about an applet. However you express your data be it in some sort of serializible format like EARL or Sirus or whatever you are using, a plain Word document, I think that many still do, just you write your report. It doesn’t matter. The ACT Rules Format is really about making sure that results are consistent. About having a procedure that you follow to ensure consistency across different tests and across different organizations. So then how you express those results, that’s the second question, that’s a separate question. There are some references to EARL in the ACT Rules Format simply because you can’t talk about accessibility testing without saying okay, this is a pass and this is a fail. And we need to say that in one way or another. But the serializible format that you express those results in are not part of the rules format. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Great. Thanks, Wilco. Let’s move on to the next question. Antonio says on IRC in chat, I’m very interested in understandable principle not only from a formal point of view. He goes on to ask accessibility content is less covered by WCAG 2, even in WCAG 2.1. Would like to contribute at this level in writing ACT rules. And the answer is as earlier said one of the clear limitations here we are not trying to define here any additional requirements. That’s a whole different beast to actually come to agreement on what is actually an accessibility requirement. We leave that exercise to the Working Group itself, which is having a lot of fun with that. If you want to get involved in that we do need all the hands that we can get on deck. There is a cognitive accessibility task force. There is a lot of work going on there. There is a lot of complexity of why this is so difficult to put some of these requirements in to testable statements. From an ACT perspective what we have agreed on is that there will be so called the conformance tests, these are what absolutely meet WCAG and then best practices. We have agreed to have best practices. So we know that a lot of things kind of pass conformance but are really ugly and really bad practice. So yeah, we could have rules that say hey, you know, this technically passes the requirements but it is still a warning or a bad practice or something. So we could have these kinds of rules. We are trying to focus right now obviously more on the more low hanging fruit just to demonstrate and get this snowball rolling first, that’s our first priority. We can do some of this work as so called best practices. Later on I think a lot of the cognitive aspects are also addressed by techniques and how can create things in good practice. So we can have rules for that. But we do not intend here with ACT to define any additional requirements. I think that also answers Jennifer’s support for Antonio’s comment here of the relationship between ACT rules and additional WCAG requirements. Charles says from the discussion possibility of a percentage outcome or other model in addition to simple pass/fail outcome. Here this is a recurring issue as well of so called metrics. Measuring accessibility and it would be so great to have, you know, to say this website is X percent accessible. But we couldn’t really come up with that means. We meaning W3C, we looked at this before, I will put an IRC and link for those who are not on IRC. It is W3.org/wai/2011/metrics. And so years and years ago in 2011 we held an online symposium like this one, only it was longer and we had people actually submit position papers on how they actually do some metrics calculations, how they come up with measuring the state of a website. We came to the conclusion that until today that’s valid, we haven’t found a single widely accepted process for doing that. There are a number of different approaches be it in Germany. There is an approach that is being used by the BITV Test and the idea of Barrier Walkthrough developed by Georgio Brajnik and others. There is several attempts but they have become so complex to calculate or a measurement that doesn’t reflect the accessibility requirements anymore. We have come up with four, I believe four requirements. I can’t remember them. Accuracy, sensitivity, complexity and there was another four dimension maybe to measure how qualitative a metric is and we haven’t found any that meet all these requirements. Thank you, Glenda. Thank you. Validity, reliability, complexity and sensitivity. And if you are trying to come up with how to measure the state of a website, you should try to address these like how valid is really the metric. How reliable it is and so on. This is also another piece that is out of scope of the ACT work. I know this comes very often in relation to testing and evaluation is having some percentage or some outcome. So far the WCAG model is pass/fail. And this is what we are using in ACT as well. The whole idea of aggregation and coming up with a final number, that’s out of scope of ACT work. And something that I think that continues to be very interesting research work here. And maybe Charles, you are involved in some of that, maybe Silver is the exploration for the new generation guidelines, 3.0 maybe that was, you know, maybe that will be a different model there. Daniel Montalvo: I’m Daniel Montalvo, working in a group of ONCE in Spain as an accessibility coordinator. My question is, you know, whether or not you are thinking in this scope of the ACT project to incorporate some of the assistive technology behavior once we can conclude the rules have passed. And I gave you the example of the ARIA described by attributes. I think something could be done to document, you know, the screen behaviors and the fact that they are described, value is or going to be held after the accessible main because it computes as accessible description. The same could be said, for example, if you are going to create rules about the title attribute and so on and so forth. I don’t know if you are thinking about that or something out of scope or what are your thoughts about it. Wilco Fiers: I knew it was coming my way. So the answer is yes, but only to a minimal extent. So what we couldn’t really do as part of ACT rules is specific documentation of things that may not work. Right? So we can’t explicitly say screen reader X doesn’t support Y. Because they may contest that. There may be different things that are disabled by default. There may be bugs. There is all sorts of gaps and difficulties that come up with your work as accessibility supports and that’s kind of what this is about. This is an accessibility support question. How much of this is supported in different assistive technologies. What is part of the ACT Rule is a section on accessibility support as part of every rule where it may be necessary that you document hey, we know there are assistive technologies that have some limitations. So you could in a rule where there are known gaps in assistive technologies you could add that information in. Say hey, as of the writing you know there are some limitations of certain assistive technologies without going in to high level of detail what those are and make that notes. Where it then continues and the reason why we put that section in we hope this will encourage organizations that actually do the limitation. So to developers, so accessibility agencies to take that information and run with it, to do some of their own testing to make sure that that information is then exposed to their clients to their users. So we did pick this up as one of the things that we are trying to encourage, but we can’t explicitly add that in to a rule because then you are essentially hard coding bugs in to documents which hopefully should live much longer than the bugs. So I’m hoping that kind of answers that question. Daniel Montavlo: Yes. It does. I mean the accessibility and I was going to ask but you already mentioned. So thank you. I was going to ask about what your expectations, not just from your host, but from the way in which the other organizations are going to use that and you have pretty much answered me. So thank you very much. Wilco Fiers: And I know that different organizations are looking at this. Some of them more explicitly than others. And it probably is a thing that the accessibility community as a whole has been kind of ignoring and thinking not being too sure about what to do with that. But I’m hoping by putting it in to the rules format that we do encourage people to start thinking about it more often because I think we do have a rather long way to go before we can do accessibility support properly. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Thanks. We also have Kathy. Kathy, do you want to speak up or maybe introduce yourself and some of the work that you are doing if you want to answer your question? Okay. I’m not hearing anything. I am not sure if your audio works. Kathy writes I am curious how automated would be one set of ACT Rules. Now so we actually started off with the idea of having rules that are categorized, let’s say automated and then other, semi automated and others that are manual. And then maybe with time as we have more Artificial Intelligence, and, you know, more advanced tooling and so on that some of these will wander off from being automated to semi automated or semi automated to automated. I came to the conclusion that it doesn’t make any sense at all in my head anymore. I think that’s a common for the rest of the Working Group is also at this stage. But this is where I am. And we actually move away from this categorization of automated, semi automated and manual because the intersection is just so strong. So let’s say this keyboard one, this rule that we looked at, well, you know, maybe rules will start showing you some of the components. Maybe they will be able to test the let’s say native components, native form fields but they can’t do that in things that are developed through JavaScript or something. So maybe you will have certain limitations. Maybe the tools can do five of the eight tests and then three others the developer has to do manually or evaluators. We are not planning to differentiate anymore or to say this has to be done manually or this has to be done automatically but maybe provide here the applicability and expectations. This was one of the major changes between the previous draft and this draft is to make that shift to applicability and expectations that describe what the outcomes will be, not really how to do it and let whatever can be tool support be tool support. And whatever needs to be done manually and that also may be the difference between one methodology and the other. The question that we had earlier about how do these different implementations look like. Maybe one methodology, you know, involves the use of tools that will do more semi automated checking while the other methodology that is more manual of that’s a matter of taste and flavor. But this is where the methodology developers, this is where you people, where you take these rules and interpret them in to your methodologies or tools. They are not intended directly to the evaluator. I am seeing some agreement. Glenda, you have been so patient. Why don’t you go ahead. Glenda Sims: I wanted to voice my support for the actuals and as a person working at Deque leading the accessibility experts there, we have more than 50 without our internal description of what is a failure and what’s not, I’ll get inconsistencies. That’s how I have got to consistency at Deque. I have put a lot of work in that. But if we want accessibility to move forward and to be attainable and easy and sustainable by people that haven’t done accessibility for ten plus years this is exactly what you need. So I’m thrilled about this. I can’t wait to contribute to it. Because it is just going to make those areas of WCAG that are more complex and nuanced to understand more attainables for everyone and with that being on that merry go round of is this a failure or not. I’m delighted and very supportive. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Great. Thank you. And you had some comments on the categorization as well. Glenda Sims: Absolutely. Absolutely. So when I heard you say that originally you had listed whether this rule was better suited, actually better suit for automated or was it something that you would expect semi automation or something you are like you know, the only way we can think of it today is manual, I do see value in that. But I get where it may not be in scope in this first round. Sounded to me as you were talking about that first round is let’s agree on defining how you test the accessibility test rule. And then you swing that through perhaps an update from an efficiency standpoint because knowing there are some people that I’ll walk up to and they will test something and they will be doing it manually where there is a tool that could have done it for them in under a second. That’s wasted time. So I see that that categorization while tricky to maintain its accuracy for is filled just manual, will be excellent for research for efficiency purposes. Wilco Fiers: Just to add on a discussion. It was a painful thing to drop the categorization to me personally but we didn’t entirely drop. So what is the proposal is that instead of making it part of a rule and saying this rule is automated, this rule is not, what we are going to do we are going to track to implement the rule because we need to know that anyway because when you are when you want a certain number of implementations before a rule gets published and as part of that process tracking who implemented was it automatically, was it manual and that way we still get that data. But it might be different for different organizations. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Yeah, thanks for this clarification. Good point actually. I didn’t talk much about that because we are not there yet but we do actually hope to have implementers declare not only which check they implement but also which individual test cases and how, whether they do that automatically or manually or whatever. And this will first give people an overview of which methodologies they can use for which purposes. But it would also I think also give us an understanding of where in researchers where there is more room for automation and work here. Charu Phandi: Hi. This is Charu. I also work for IBM accessibility research. And I wanted to say this is an excellent effort. Thank you, Shadi, Wilco, Mary Jo for leading this. I think it is much needed because the interpretation of the WCAG is so subjective and, you know, it leads to inconsistency in the validation from organization to organization. I think this effort will really help harmonizing all that and also save all the duplication. Like, Wilco, you mentioned each organization is doing their own thing and they have so much not only consistency but duplication. I’m so glad. And hope to contribute more. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Yeah, thank you. And all the participants in this work. This is a group effort of an entire task force and the invitation here for everyone to get involved. You can get involved either if you want to develop more of the specific area of the work, the rules format and the review process or if you want to get in to writing rules or commenting on rules I will provide again the links toward the end. We are actually starting to close. So if you want to say any final words now is the time to get on queue because we are kind of going towards the end here. Daniel Montavlo: Yep. As I said in the IRC just I saw those references to the different abilities that user profile should in order to be able to perform these kind of semi automated testings or manual testings. In fact, there is the confirmation for the evaluators to actually confirm that the role has passed or not. Have you dropped this already as kind of dropped the automated and semi automated thing or not? Shadi Abou-Zahra: Wilco, do you want to take that? In auto-WCAG there is information on user profiles. I think the answer is that this is outdated because the auto-WCAG is following on from what has been defined from ACT, but can you confirm that? Wilco Fiers: Yeah. The auto-WCAG rules while like Shadi said latest drop got updated less than a week ago. We are dragging a bit and it will take time to update the rules. User profiles, I’m not sure that we are going to keep this. I think that falls in line with the question of what do you actually automate or not. That may be more of a question for implementers than is something that should be part of the rule. But that is a discussion we haven’t had yet. I had a question. And the question was kind of for the rest of the group, especially people not involved in the work, and it is what, how could we help to let you contribute to the support. The more voices we have the better the quality and the more we use and are going to get out of this. Just a thought. Please jump on queue if you have anything to say. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Very good point. What can we do to help you get more involved. Brian actually asked a very good related question. He is trying to get some of his colleagues up to speed what does he need to give them basically. What do they need to know. What should they read. I will answer that question in the closing and give some pointers but as Wilco says this is by no means the answer. This is what we currently have. We know there is still a lot more help that we need to do. We know that a lot of these terminologies and groups and it is sometimes confusing. So your feedback will be very helpful. Also after the call feel free to send us your thoughts and comments and we will consider this as we go along. And your input is very valuable and very much needed. Katie Haritos-Shea: My name is Katie. I have been with the WCAG Working Group and at the W3C on various WAI groups as well as a representative for accessibility and other W3C Working Groups. But when Wilco first started this community group it was more than three years ago, wasn’t it? Like four? And everyone, this is obviously such a great idea. And, you know, it was a few people on Skype and besides watching the technology change, you know, at the W3C and somebody gets an idea and then it turns in to this real thing, some of them don’t make it and some of them do. But this is something that couldn’t make me happier being so much of my life having been involved with the development of WCAG 2 and working on WCAG 2.1. This is just something that is so needed. It has been needed. And for some reason had a hard time getting off the ground. But everyone who can please, please join this group. Either the Working Group or the community group. This is going to help all of us in our evaluations, in our work and are providing consistency really for the world and giving credibility to what accessibility is and how important it is and how it can be not something as contentious as somebody’s opinion. It doesn’t cover everything. We know that. But this is a very direct, organized way for competing companies to still be able to do what they can do but make sure that the outcome for users which is where, why this whole thing happens is going to be consistent. I don’t have any more time but I am thrilled. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Thank you for these words and we will contact you, but actually this question I wanted to pick up. I think, you know, several questions now are how can we get involved or get other people involved either as good, either get involved yourself or push others to getting involved and that’s fine as well. There is a lot of work that needs to be done and there is a lot of ways in which you can contribute. So let’s move on to wrapping up and closing and giving you some of the pointers, some of the information on how you can get involved. I agree with Louis, I know a lot of the W3C stuff is confusing and overwhelming in these different groups. Wrap-up and Closing So slide No. 19, just to wrap up again, a reminder the ACT rules format is out for public review. The link is in the slides but I’ll read it out. It is w3.org/tr/act-rules-format. And that’s the technical specification really defining how these rules look like. It also points to some of the exampled rules that we saw today. So this is really the basis for all this work. We hope that this will be our last as we are maturing on this. Please send your comments by the 5th of April on this. This is one way you can contribute is by sending your comments on this. Anybody can do that. The second is the auto-WCAG community group. This is as I said earlier a community group which is open to anyone. This is the place where rules are being developed. And in a community, so outside the Working Group. But if they follow this review process, demonstrate consensus and implementation, then these rules will essentially wander over to the W3C repository and become “formal” rules. The link is also in the slides. I will read it out. Auto-WCAG.GitHub.io/auto-WCAG. The auto WCAG group is open to anybody who wants to participate if you want to send comments on rules that are in development. If you want to develop rules, if you have ideas for rules that you’d like to develop, if you want to be involved in the development. So, you know, this keyboard rule that is being developed if you want to be involved in that development, if you want to implement such rule that’s really the place to interact. This is where the rules development will be happening. And then next is the ACT task force itself, which is part of the W3C Working Group and that’s where the rules format and the review process is being defined. So this is open to the W3 member organizations. In some cases we can have invited experts under very specific conditions. So but you can always comment all the work is being done in GitHub. You can always send comments and issues and the URL for this work is w3c.GitHub.io/WCAG-Act-rules. If you go there, Brian, that’s your question earlier, where do you send colleagues. We are trying to make that link, the last one that I just read out, that link really the place to go to. If you go to that link you will find some initial information and overview where the different bits and pieces are. We are going to be updating that page and providing more information, like the diagram that we showed today, maybe that helps also explain, put things in to perspective. So we will put a bit more information there. But that will be the place where you can send people. If anybody has further ideas of how we can provide more support, how we can help you or your colleagues get involved, do let us know. So these are the places where you can get involved. And if you have any questions, write me or us. I see Wilco already taking the names of people. And we’ll be reaching out to you as well in order to help you get involved. Good. I think we are coming towards the end of the call. Before we do that just, Wilco and Mary Jo, again any wrap up comments? Wilco Fiers: No. Just to say thank you very much to Shadi. I wouldn’t have had the time for doing this. Thank you very much. Mary Jo Mueller: Yeah, totally. Thank you for organizing this, Shadi. And I really do encourage folks to participate and contribute to our work. And we feel it is very important and it sounds like from you very important to you. So it all doesn’t come together unless we all work together to get it done. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Well, speaking about staying in the loop, so this online symposium here today was organized by the WAI-Tools Project, the EC funded project. A lot of thanks for that contribution. Without this, a lot of the work would not be possible. Through this project we are planning to do more such webinars, seminars, maybe also face to face meetings. We are looking at maybe in the fall in Germany a face to face meeting. There is also the ICT testing symposium in the fall where we may be doing or, you know, hoping to do a pre-conference workshop maybe. So we are going to be trying to do more kind of events in the coming period with the support of this so you can get more involved or get your colleagues more involved. If you do have more questions or ideas, also if you go to that Web page, there is a list that you can subscribe to a newsletter to get updates from that project. So you get informed, when we organize such an event through the project. So if you are interested in getting such newsletter update go to that Web page and subscribe. It is only when we have events or certain results from projects, things like that we send around. So we will be doing more of this stuff. Today was specifically focused on people who are doing manual evaluation and developing manual methodologies because we need to do more work here. We are really looking forward to hearing from you, hearing your thoughts how we can improve this work to better support you in developing your methodologies and making those consistent with the standards and interpretation worldwide. So let us know how we can help you in that mission. I want to thank everyone for all this work, in particular the working group participants, task force participants and people in the auto-WCAG. And all this work is done by the people in the groups. And you have heard how many people it takes to contribute to get this international consensus. So thank you, everyone. This concludes today’s symposium. And we’ll stay in touch and all the best for everyone. Thank you.",

    "text": "Sponsors This online symposium was organized with support of the WAI-Tools Project, funded by the European Commission Invitation WAI-Tools Project invited developers of manual web accessibility evaluation methodologies, to participate in an online symposium on W3C Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules, to: Learn about the W3C ACT Rules Exchange your perspectives Discuss ideas for improvement Get involved in W3C ACT effort This online symposium was held on 14 March 2018 at 14:00 to 16:00 UTC , free of charge. Background The W3C Accessibility Conformance Testing ACT Rules provide transparent and vetted checks for accessibility conformance of web content to the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). They are intended to help align conformance evaluation across accessibility testing tools and manual evaluation methodologies, to provide more reliability and trust. ACT Rules are contributed by volunteer organizations and individuals using the ACT Rules Format specification and following the ACT Review Process. However, these resources and processes are currently in development, with more input needed to refine them. In particular, more input is need to optimize the relevance of ACT Rules for manual evaluation methodologies. Objective The objective of this online symposium was to bring together developers of manual web accessibility evaluation methodologies, to explore the use of ACT Rules for their particular situation, and to invite participation this effort. Specific questions for this online symposium included: How do ACT Rules map to your evaluation procedures? What benefits are there for you in using ACT Rules? What challenges are there for you in using ACT Rules? Which modifications to the ACT Rules would help you? How likely are you willing to contribute ACT Rules? We asked interested participants to consider these questions in advance of the online symposium, and to share some of their thoughts with us through the registration form. This was to contribute to a more effective discussion and exchange of ideas. In particular, we were interested in your ideas on how we can improve the design of ACT Rules, including the ACT Rules Format specification and Review Process, to make them work better for your particular situation. Agenda Slides and Meeting Record are available. Logistics This online symposium used: Teleconference bridge with web-based and phone access; Live captioning of the discussion; Inter-Relay Chat (IRC) for additional interaction. Registration Registration is now closed. Please contact Shadi Abou-Zahra if you have questions.

In this case, audio description would be more distracting than useful to most people, including people who cannot see the visuals. The Transcript with Description below includes descriptions of the supporting visuals. Text Transcript with Description of Visuals This is video is accompanied by slides 01 Visual Audio [Shadi speaking] Slide 1: About the Project Just a little bit about the project itself. WAI-Tools Project is an acronym for Advanced Decision Support Tools for Scalable Web Accessibility Assessments of the Web Accessibility Initiative. So, WAI-Tools. So, it’s a project of the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative co-funded by the European Commission, the EC, under the Horizon 2020 program. It’s a so-called Innovation Action project. So there are different types of projects that the European Commission supports and this is one of them. It’s under the line of innovation action. It started on the 1st of November in 2017. It also – it already feels like many decades ago. And unfortunately actually, coming to an end at the end of this month. As I mentioned, it’s been a really great project, great fun working with the partners. Slide 2: Project Partners Speaking of the partners of the project, the lead partner is the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics, ERCIM which is the European host for W3C. So, this is the legal footing of W3C in Europe. Other partners in the project are Siteimprove from Denmark, the Accessibility Foundation in the Netherlands, the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency, Digdir, and the Administrative Modernization Agency in Portugal, AMA. The University of Lisbon, FCID, in Portugal, and Deque Research which is based in the Netherlands. So, these are the project partners who together are responsible for moving this forward, this project, but really a lot of this work is happening or happened in – directly in open W3C groups and we’re going to be talking more about that, about how the project work has happened and how you can still contribute to some of this project work which is going to continue happening in these groups. Slide 3: Objective 1 But just to give you a little bit of the objectives of the project, what did we really want to achieve with the project? One of the main objectives here on the screen is an illustration where at the very top of the illustration is kind of the ultimate goal. We all want compatible results, right? When we are evaluating for the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines which is the layer below, we’re evaluating for accessibility or testing for accessibility, we’re using different methodologies, so different methods. But at the end of the day, we’re testing for the same set of guidelines and we want to get compatible results. We want to get the same results when we test the same things, right, no matter how we actually test them. Same slide; highlight around \"ACT Test Rules (open royalty free)\" middle layer of the diagram And so, this was really the focus of the project, to look at what we call ACT test rules, Accessibility Conformance Testing rules. The point is these are very, very small procedures for testing that can be combined together for different methodologies. And methodologies here is a broad term. It could be automated tools or anything. Any procedure that you follow for manually checking, this is a methodology as well. So, really, anything that encodes how you check accessibility is a methodology. It could be manual. It could be automated. It could be a combination, semi-automated, so a combination of automated and non-automated approaches together. So, if we have very small building blocks, and they are depicted here as these small boxes, these small squares, very, very small, like Lego pieces, we can combine these together to provide different methodologies but at the end of the day, if we test the same thing, we want to get the same result. So, that’s really the objective or the vision of the project is to try to get consistency because we know that one of the big issues of accessibility right now is that we don’t have that consistency. We have different tools that provide different results or different evaluation methods. So, you go to one person and you get one result and then sometimes you can get slightly different results when you go to a different person to get it checked. That’s a big problem for accessibility that we’re trying to address to have more consistency of how we test. Slide 4: Objective 2 Another objective of the project, by defining these checks and finally agreeing on them and not having to constantly re-repeat how we test certain things, how do we test the text alternative or how do we test the label. If we can finally decide and agree on a common interpretation for these checks, maybe we can increase automation in that. Right now, a very large part of accessibility needs to be tested manually. But we also know that there is a lot of advancements happening in the technology. Buzzwords, artificial intelligence or machine learning, natural language processing. All of these technologies are evolving, all of these innovations that would essentially allow us to increase the level of automation. It doesn’t mean that accessibility will be fully automatable, at least in the foreseeable future, but at least we can maybe increase the amount of tool support which would be – would make things much more effective and much more efficient if we can increase this level of automation. Slide 5: Project Deliverables So, these are really the objectives or the core pieces of the project. The deliverables of the project, which we’re going to go into more detail, but hopefully from a more applied side, is the main part of the project, the heart piece is to develop Accessibility Conformance Testing rules, right. So, this is to create an initial set hopefully to get the work in the community kickstarted to help establish an active community that will sustain beyond the project. So, this is a call on – call for action for you to get involved in this work that will continue beyond the project. We implemented these rules that we developed in different tools from project partners in the project, here specifically the partners Siteimprove in their checker called Alfa, in Deque in their checker called Axe-core, and in – a tool from the University of Lisbon in a checker called QualWeb. And we also validated these rules in real-life situations. We had a set of websites that we took and that we ran these rules across. Now, these rules were applied in different ways, were test-driven, or were taken up by the Portuguese and Norwegian observatories. These were part of the project to kind of really ground us and look at when entire countries want to do large scale monitoring of accessibility, what are their needs? What can we learn from that? And how can we provide them with different types of rules that will support getting them valuable information? We looked at improving the existing WCAG-EM Report Tool. So, people might know that tool. It already existed. WCAG-EM stands for WCAG evaluation methodology. It actually has a longer name, Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology. It’s a long name. But this is an evaluation methodology for WCAG that can be used to test entire websites. And it was a tool to help you walk through that and now we have added to that tool an import function so that you can import test results from automated tools, again here to show the idea that we can combine automated and manual when we’re using open standards here. We also created an accessibility statements generator tool. So, this helps you create accessibility statements for your website once you have done the testing to explain to the world the accessibility that you have on your website. And last but not least, a demo, a proof of concept to show, to demonstrate the potential of open linked data for accessibility. So, what if – right – what if we had these test results being published, at least those by public bodies, and we could connect these and we could scrape these and we could do a more active or decentralized monitoring approach? Slide 6: Project Results and Furhter Information So, these are the project deliverables. More information is on the website. We will provide you these links at the end again so you don’t need to start looking at the links. The address is w3.org/WAI/Tools.

Text Transcript with Description of Visuals This is video is accompanied by slides 02 Visual Audio [Shadi speaking] Title Slide: ACT Rules Developmeent So, let’s move directly to our first session on the development of Accessibility Conformance Testing rules. I want to ask on the virtual stage, Wilco Fiers from Deque and Kasper Isager from Siteimprove and Carlos Duarte – Carlos Duarte from University of Lisbon. If the three of you could just briefly – Wilco can you say a few words about yourself, just introduce yourself to the audience. [Wilco speaking] I sure can. Can you guys hear me alright? [Shadi speaking] Yep. All fine. [Wilco speaking] Fantastic. Alright, so my name is Wilco Fiers. I work for Deque Systems. I am a product owner and project manager. There, I am responsible for Axe-core which is Deque’s open source accessibility engine which Shadi mentioned. In addition to that, I spend part of my time on W3C activities. I am the chair of the ACT Rules Community Group, a facilitator on the ACT Task Force, as well as a member of the Silver Task Force which is currently developing WCAG 3. [Shadi speaking] Thank you, Wilco. And all these groups that Wilco mentioned, the task force and community group and so on, will be explained in this presentation. [Wilco speaking] Don’t worry about. We’ll get it. We’ll get to it. [Shadi speaking] We’ll get there. Piece by piece. We love acronyms in W3C. [Wilco speaking] I have too many hats also, to be fair. [Shadi speaking] Kasper, please introduce yourself. [Kasper speaking] Yes, I will make it short. I don’t have as many hats. My name is Kasper Isager and I work as the product owner of Alfa at Siteimprove. And then Alfa is our accessibility conformance test engine. [Shadi speaking] Welcome. Well, you don’t need to be so humble. Kasper is a mastermind of a lot of the accessibility engines at Siteimprove as far as I know. [Carlos speaking] Hi, I’m Carlos Duarte. I teach – well my main responsibility is to teach computer science at the University of Lisbon, although my research is focused a lot on web accessibility. And so, as part of my responsibilities in teaching computer science, I also teach web accessibility to my students and I also have some more hats. Together with Wilco, I’m co-chairing the ACT Community Group and also another hat for the W3C where I do work for the Education and Outreach Working Group, specifically on preparing the new – the curricula, the new web accessibility curricula. [Shadi speaking] Thank you, Carlos. And Wilco, go ahead. Take it away please with the presentation. And this time you are muted. [Wilco speaking] Slide 2: Goals of ACT I should unmute. Do you mind going to the next slide? Thank you very much. So, I just wanted to get into the goals of ACT really quick. Again, ACT stands for Accessibility Conformance Testing. The project wasn’t setup as part of WAI-Tools. It predates it by several years. Some of you may also know it as Auto-WCAG which is a group that later got renamed to the ACT Rules Group. And the reason that group was started off is to improve consistency in accessibility testing. So, one of the greater challenges Shadi mentioned is consistent testing. You do want, when you get a report from somebody, for that report to be accurate and based on well-founded ideas. Otherwise, you might fix something and you have somebody else take a look at it and they find more things. Or they may find completely contradicting things which can be fairly frustrating. If you don’t have a clear definition of when your project is sufficiently accessible, that makes life pretty hard. This kind of gets exacerbated when you look at something like European Union which is starting to track the accessibility of government websites across the whole of Europe. If Denmark tests things in a different way than the Netherlands does, what you’ll end up with is with results that don’t – aren’t very comparable. Even worse, you might have a website that is relevant in multiple countries and if they used different testing methodologies to gauge whether or not you complied with the law – because that’s what we’re getting to at a certain point; it should be legally required to meet these standards – if they are testing along different methods, you may find that your website complies in one country but not in the other even though you’re testing along the same WCAG standard. So, that’s really the issue and the problem isn’t too extreme. Like, it’s not like WCAG is all over the place and results go anywhere. But there are differences there and it kind of erodes the trust that you can get from results like that. So, that is what ACT was setup to do. And our goal there is, as I mentioned, we started first off with Auto-WCAG which is really focused on doing this for automation. But then we broadened it out to address testing methodologies as well. And testing methodology is not a well-established term but if you ask around in accessibility institutions around the world, most of them have some sort of document that tells you how to interpret WCAG, like what you do with this particular element on a page and with that particular element on a page. One of the great things about the kind of accessibility guidelines is that it was written in a way that it is technology agnostic so that it can live for a long time, so that it isn’t just applicable to one particular version of the web standards, but it should be applicable to all of them. But that also means there is some vagueness there that does require that interpretation. So those interpretations, those are what we are trying to capture with the ACT Rules and so this is applicable really to lots and lots of organizations. Next slide please. Slide 3: Benefits of ACT So, we’ve developed this rules format, the ACT Rules Format, and the benefits of that are fairly wide. So, like I mentioned, we’ve been working with this format for several years now. That is really the goal of this project, is to use the rules format and develop these rules. And it has really improved the quality of the organizations that have adopted this, like in noticeable ways things have gotten more consistent. That has been between the project partners but also organizations outside of the WAI-Tools Project that have been using the ACT Rules to make their tools, to make their testing methodologies more consistent. So, we are seeing concrete evidence that this approach seems to be working. By writing these rules, we then have a more authoritative set of things that we know are conforming to WCAG or are not conforming to WCAG and what we’ve ended up doing is to share these rules with the W3C and to have those published. There are currently eleven of the rules that have been developed, that have been published by the W3C. So, these are really validated by the people that wrote the standard. So, this gives us a lot more credibility as well for the work that we’ve done. This is the way you’re supposed to interpret WCAG for the HTML standard or for SVG documents. And by doing this, we resolve a lot of open questions for WCAG. One example of such a question is if you have an image with the text right next to it and the image basically says the same as the text, does that image need to have a text alternative or not? It’s kind of a debated question. Some accessibility experts say yes, some accessibility experts say no, you absolutely should not do that, and the rules answer this question for us definitively so we do not have to have these conversations anymore. It clears things up in a lot of ways. And by clearing this up, we enable organizations to test more consistently, which – allows accessibility results to be more widely trusted. You can trust that one organization using ACT Rules will produce almost identical results to another organization using those same sets of rules. There can still be small differences but the differences are far smaller than what they used to be. Next slide please. Slide 4: Festures of ACT So, just to get into some of the things that you get from ACT Rules. I think I might have been going over time already, so I’ll keep that quick. So, ACT Rules use unambiguous language which is great because it helps you answer things in a very precise way. If you need to know what something means, how to interpret a thing, the ACT Rules offer a very precise description. So there’s no more, well, it depends kind of thing going on. ACT Rules are very clear on when something should pass and when something should fail. ACT Rules also document assistive technologies. If something doesn’t work in some screen readers but it does in others, you can find that information in the rules and this helps you frame how to understand the results. So, in some cases you may still see an issue if you try something with a particular screen reader that you don’t see in the report. That really helps you understand what the results actually mean. Then they document assumptions. So, if there are very unlikely edge cases or if there’s a particular interpretation that may be controversial or that is unusual, then that will be documented in the rule itself so you will understand why is the result the way it is and that really helps you frame the results again. And then lastly but not least important either, diagnostic for tools and methodologies. We want ACT Rules to be something that can be implemented irrespective of whether or not you’re doing it manually or if you’re automating. That really shouldn’t matter. It shouldn’t matter if you’re using a particular technology stack in your tool or some other technology stack. These are written in a way that everybody is doing accessibility testing. Whether it be fully automated or completely manual or somewhere in between, you should be able to implement these. I think with that, I am passing it on to Kasper. [Kasper speaking] Slide 5: ACT Rules Developed By The Project Alrighty. So, I will just briefly talk about the rules that we developed as part of the project and then also briefly touch on how these were actually developed. So, just for an overview, we initially set out to develop a total of seventy of these ACT Rules, of which we wanted thirty to be fully automatable, twenty-five of them were to be semi-automatable, and fifteen were to be completely manual rules. And we started out by trying to cover as much crowd as possible in terms of the type of content that the rules dealt with. So, we were looking at the text content, graphics, audio/visual media, all the stuff that was really based on, in many cases, the existing rulesets that the individual project partners already had implemented in their individual tools. And then later on as the project progressed, we started seeing more and more specialized rules focused on increasingly narrow aspects of their content. We started looking at stuff like orientational arcs implemented using CSS and also things like CSS declarations that couldn’t be overwritten by the users. So, much more specialized failure cases than the stuff that we initially covered. We also ended up developing several rules that didn’t relate directly to the WCAG but we are looking at things like WAI-ARIA conformance and also its associated authoring practices that define best practices for use of WAI-ARIA. And with that, I will cue the next slide. Slide 6: How ACT Rules Were Developed Thank you. So, as already mentioned, these rules were developed in an open W3C Community Group, and within that group the first thing we of course had to decide, also among the project partners, were which rules we actually wanted to develop. And for this, we had a list of a defined selection criteria so we would look at things like, so, a proposed rule for example or how many new additional success criteria from the WCAG does it cover that we haven’t already covered, and what is the, sort of the options both across the project partners and how easy would it be to implement in our tools, and also how likely was it that this was a rule that would be picked up by the community. And then once we had selected rules to develop, we would incubate them in this open community group with input both from the project partners but also the wider community. And this is really when the bulk of the work was spent, with the biggest and most important point probably being reaching a consensus on interpretation of whatever success criteria it was that the rule is supposed to test and also researching, like, the real world implications of what the rule would look at, figuring out so under what assumptions would the thing that the rule looked at actually be a problem. And in case those assumptions didn’t hold, then would there actually be an actual problem? So, really finding out where, you know, theory and reality aligned and agreeing on an interpretation that will then form the basis of the rules that we developed. And once we had the rules developed, they were implemented by the project partners in our various tools and also validated by another project partner on this fixed set of real web pages that we had selected beforehand. And then once implemented and validated and matured in the community, we would ship them off to the ACT Task Force to eventually be included as official live resources on the WAI webpage. And with that, I will pass it on to Carlos. [Carlos speaking] Slide 7: Adoption and Impact of ACT Rules Thank you, Kasper. I’m going to start by talking a bit about how does this impact you, okay. So, what does it mean for you, for the community, that we have developed seventy rules? So, first it means that we now have more than seventy different aspects about WCAG that at least three different organizations agree on how they need to be tested. Okay, so I think this is already very significant. And when I say at least three different organizations, I’m not saying three different project partners, and this is something that Kasper just talked about. So, because the main work we’ve done in this project was done in the scope of the ACT Community Group, which means that it was an open group and its work was publicly available. So, we are not just three project partners reaching consensus. It’s wider than that. And there were involvement at different levels from these organizations outside the project that fortunately was not just at the rule writing and reviewing level. So, not surprisingly, the project partners included in their products, the ACT Rules that we were developing. But I think we can say that we are really happy to see that other organizations started to do the same. So, the other two vendors have now products that include conformance testing using ACT Rules, manual testing methodologies that also include ACT Rules. So, from this you can understand that ACT Rules already have an impact on several tools, on several methodologies, and let me stress this out again, not only from the tools and methodologies made available by the project partners. So, if you use one of these tools or if you have your projects checked with one of those methodologies, then ACT Rules have already impacted you, and we can also say – you will be able to hear about this in the next presentation – that these tools and these methodologies are being used by monitoring bodies across Europe. So, we are already witnessing the impact of ACT Rules at a large scale. And we believe that ACT Rules will play an important role for the European monitoring efforts as Wilco said. So, given the consistency that the ACT Rules offer, even when monitoring agencies from different countries use different tools, if those tools implement ACT Rules, then their results can be compared with a higher degree of confidence. We think this is already a great start but in the future, we can only hope that the impact will be even bigger. So, as also Wilco mentioned, eleven of the ACT Rules developed by the project and adopted by the community have already been published by the W3C. There are more in the pipeline that should soon increase this number and I think that the interest in ACT Rules is only bound to grow when the community starts finding ACT Rules elsewhere. Shadi, can you move to the next slide, please? Slide 8: Understanding ACT Rules Thanks. So, you have a screenshot, so a sneak peek at the Understanding document for WCAG 2.2 soon to be released. And you can find there – yes, thanks, Shadi – a new section on Understanding ACT Rules and we have this section at the same level that we have currently for the Understanding Techniques for WCAG’s success criteria. So, this is really exciting and we are really seeing ACT Rules being adopted and promoted. Slide 9: Getting Involved in Further work Okay, so now I want to talk to you about how you can contribute to keep ACT Rules going on. So, we like to believe that this was a successful project and that we really kickstarted the work on ACT Rules but now it’s up to you, to the community to keep this momentum going. And fortunately, there are many ways in which you can contribute. For instance, if you are a tool or a methodology developer, you can start by checking how well aligned your project is to the current consensus expressed in ACT Rules. So you can read the rules that are related to the checks that you support. You can see how well you do on the published test cases. And you don’t agree with some aspect of the rule? Great. We did try our best but we know we are not flawless. So, raise an issue reporting what you found and it will be discussed in the community and the rule will be updated if needed. It wouldn’t be the first time. While you are at it, you can send us the implementation reports of your tools and methodologies. In the ACT Rules website, we have a section for implementations where all reports that we receive are displayed. So, this is a great way to let the community know that your products are supported by ACT Rules. And irrespectively of your developing tools or methodologies or being a user of such or a monitoring body or someone that’s responsible for publishing accessible information on the web, be happy because there are other ways you can help. We are always looking for more people to help reviewing rules. So, it’s great to have people with different experience and perspectives contributing to this work. If you have an idea for a rule, you can write it. Don’t worry if you feel overwhelmed about writing a rule. You can team up with others and do it as a collaborative project. That’s what we are all doing here, collaborating to make the web more accessible. And to do any of this, you don’t have to be a W3C member, but if you are or want to become one, then you can actively contribute to support the adoption of more rules into WCAG 2.2 and potentially the new WCAG 3. So, Shadi, I think we can move to the final slide. Slide 10: Thank you And you can find more details about ACT Rules and how you can join this community at act-rules.github.io. And thanks for listening and I think Shadi, now you want to take some questions, right? [Shadi speaking] Yes. Questions are coming in. Thank you, everybody who is contributing questions. If you have questions, now is the time in the Q&amp;A function. Before we get to that, just to get a little bit of a feel, how many people are subscribed to the community group and roughly how many are active in the calls and, you know, the active part of the work, not just subscribed? Who wants to take that question? [Wilco speaking] I’ll take it. It depends a little bit because there are two groups, one in W3C itself and a Community Group which has no official standing at the W3C but is hosted by it. The Community Group has, I believe, around ninety members right now. As for active participants, again that depends on how active you mean active. I think right now we have ten to twelve people that regularly attend meetings like every month, every twice a month, something like that. There’s a whole bunch of people that are slightly less active but that still regularly contribute. As a rule comes up that they are interested in, they’ll drop a review. That happens quite a lot and I frequently get surprised by new people who have come out of nowhere and submitted some information. [Shadi speaking] Thanks. Yeah, I just wanted to give a little bit of an idea and people are, as you were saying, Wilco, participating in different ways. Some people are attending the calls and discussing things. Others completely asynchronously, they are using the GitHub platform. [Wilco speaking] Yeah, it’s – it takes relatively little time for anybody to participate. You can spend as little or as much time as you want. I do also think it’s worth mentioning that just from the people that have joined over the last year maybe, year and half, I frequently hear that they join and they find it a lot of fun and they learn a lot. It is a group where you get to learn quite a lot of in-depth accessibility. So, if you’re interested in the nitty gritty details of accessibility, this is really a good group for you to participate in. [Shadi speaking] Great. So, one of the questions that we have is – I’ll read it aloud – WCAG is supposed to be interpreted to be relevant in different contexts. In one country, users might be using older assistive technology for example and it would be relevant to use all the techniques to meet the requirement. Then in a country where all users have the latest versions of assistive technology, in practice it means a solution that is good enough in Germany for example, might not be good enough in Italy for example. And that is fine. So, how do the ACT Rules take this into account? Silence? [Wilco speaking] You want to pick somebody? I mean I can answer all of them if you want, but. [Shadi speaking] Go ahead. [Wilco speaking] Okay. So, it’s a really good question. Thank you. How do ACT Rules deal with that? ACT Rules have an accessibility support section, so if we know about these differences, we will mention them in that section. You can find information about things that may work slightly differently depending on which technology you were using. That information is documented in the rule and if you happen to know any that isn’t, please open an issue and we will add it. It belongs in those documents. I also think it’s worth mentioning those differences aren’t that big anymore. The types of assistive technologies that people are using tend to be international ones. There are only a handful of big players out there, so the differences really aren’t that big anymore these days. What does matter a little bit is whether or not you exclude some of them. So, for example, if you want to exclude a common screen reader on the Mac, you might have slightly different tasks then if you wanted to include those. The rule documents this kind of information for you. That freedom is available within the rule. [Shadi speaking] Thank you. Kasper, I think this one is for you. So, do ACT Rules only cover accessibility tests that can be semi-automated or fully automated? Or are there also rules that clarify rather subjective WCAG criteria like 2.4.6, adding the label that needs to be manually evaluated? [Kasper speaking] You know, I can definitely provide an answer to that. And the answer is yes, we also have affordances for manual rules. I also mentioned we did set out to implement fifteen fully manual rules, so rules that could not reasonably be implemented in automated tools but could be implemented as part of manual test methodologies. I would say, the manual rules are slightly more difficult in the sense that you still have to follow the ACT Rules from it, of course. And the ACT Rules from it are fairly strict on what kind of rules you all have to write. One of the big things is that the applicability section of the rules for the description of what kinds of content the rule applies to has to be both completely unambiguous and objective. And for some of the success criteria, the objectiveness criteria is really difficult to meet, it has proved. So, yes, you can author manual rules using the ACT Rules format. But it may be slightly more difficult that you still have to remain objective in the applicability section of the rule and that’s difficult to do with some of the more, I would say, subjective WCAG success criteria. [Shadi speaking] Right, but that’s – I think an important – thank you, Kasper. I think that’s an important question because it also came up in the questions that people asked in the registration form. I think a lot of people think about when they hear rules, they automatically think of automated tools only and I think here it’s really important to emphasize that these apply to both manual and not – in fact, actually, we have several rules that we created as part of the project that relate to that specific success criteria on headings and we have others on labels. So, yes – it is done and we also have manual methodology developers who have been implementing these rules in their methodology, comparing their methodology. Speaking of, this is a question that also came up in the registration form. Carlos, maybe this is for you. So, somebody wants to create an implementation report for their tool or for their methodology. How do they do that? Can you first explain what an implementation report is and then how they actually do that, how they provide such information? [Carlos speaking] Yeah, sure. So, perhaps I need to start by providing a bit of context on what’s inside an ACT Rule and specifically an ACT Rule besides having an applicability and expectation as a set of examples. Some of them are examples of elements, documents, pages that meet the criteria and so pass the rules. Some of them are failed examples and some of them are examples of pieces of code that are inapplicable for that rule. So, what we expect to have in an implementation report is how well does your implementation fair against those examples? So, does it pass the test examples? Does it fail the failed examples? And does it not consider the inapplicable examples of such a rule? So, an implementation report is basically a report of the outcomes of your implementation for the different test cases that are described in an ACT Rule. How can you submit one and how can you prepare one? Well, we expect your reports to be provided using EARL. The Evaluation And Report Language, serialized in JSON-LD. So, if you do provide us that, we can import that into our website and display it together with the current displayed implementation reports. We have a section on the website, so if you go online to the website, there’s a section dedicated specifically to implementations and there are instructions there on how you can submit an implementation. And we have some tools that you can use to help you prepare an implementation report. We have all the test cases for all the rules accessible. So, it can help you prepare for implementation. If you have some problems setting up an infrastructure for preparing implementation, do reach out to us and we should be able to assist you in that, in your project. [Shadi speaking] Thank you, Carlos. While I have you on the line, we’re kind of running out of time. There are more questions coming so we might need to push some of these towards the end of the day just to move on. But I think, maybe briefly, Carlos, this one it says, can you give a concrete example of the rule on should we have alt text in an image if the text that is next to the image is the same? I think it would help to understand how you choose a specific rule. I think here, if you can explain the test cases in the context here that are part of the rules to help you understand what the rule actually refers to. [Carlos speaking] Wilco, you seem to have the rules in your head better than I. Which – this is definitely coming from the example that you gave in your presentation. Can you point me? [Shadi speaking] Sorry. We don’t actually have the time to go into this. [Carlos speaking] Okay. [Shadi speaking] We could come back to this later. So maybe let me summarize. So, the point is that this rule, there would be a rule that is talking about, let’s say text alternatives for images and these will consider different techniques and the examples, the test cases in the rule would have an example when what happens if there is a description next to the image. What in that case, what the alt text should be? So, if we were to write the rule for a good alt text, so the rule that we have right now only checks for alt text whether it exists or not. And if we would have a rule that checks how good an alt text is, it would be – we would have tests cases where we would have different types of situations and so that people could compare test cases towards that. Again, we could come back to this later on. We are kind of running out of time but one of the things that was asked is, do rules cover all of the success criteria? Or will the work continue to cover everything? Who wants to take that one? [Wilco speaking] I’ll go. So, we haven’t completed all the success criteria. I don’t know if we ever will fully complete everything but we certainly intend to continue to go on with this work. WAI-Tools Project is over but the ACT work is not. This is going to be, you know, ongoing projects to continue to extend the coverage. Some of the things not currently done is so – our main focus has been on HTML where it sees it as an SVG. There are definitely still gaps in those, specifically the things that are difficult to automate, but beyond that, there are other technologies to consider as well. There are currently no rules for PDF for example. That is certainly a thing that I would love to see us develop. So, there’s definitely more work and it is also good to mention that this is an ongoing process. As technology develops, as the HTML standard develops, as assistive technologies develop, these rules will continually get updated. So, unlike WCAG, these rules are an ongoing thing that need to be maintained so this work is never going to end and I’m going to continue doing this until I retire, so. [Shadi speaking] Yeah. I like to use the metaphor of snowballs, especially now in winter for many of us, so snowballing, and I think this project started the snowball with seventy rules and now it’s really, as Carlos was saying, now it’s up to you the community to help continue that. Speaking of, Wilco, while I have you on the line, there was a question for you. This might be a misunderstanding. Can you talk about how authoritative the ACT Rules are versus the WCAG success criteria? What is the normative part and what is informative? [Wilco speaking] That’s a fantastic question. So, the WCAG success criteria are published by the W3C as a Recommendation. They’ve gone through an extensive process of public reviews by the W3C and they are an internationally recognized standard. So, those are solid as anything. ACT Rules are written by smaller groups. They go through a less involved process of review and they get published still by the W3C but not by the whole of the W3C. There is no massive W3C-wide review but there is a review and an approval that comes from the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group which are the authors of WCAG. So, you can see them as these are rules published by the authors of WCAG, whereas WCAG itself is published by the W3C as a standards organization as a whole, so. [Shadi speaking] Thanks. We call these – internally we call them supporting documents. These are the so-called Techniques documents, the Understanding documents - Understanding WCAG 2. So, with every success criteria, there is a document associated with it called Understanding Success Criteria XYZ that explains more background and would help and so on. Then there are several Techniques, how you can meet that requirement, and now we also have tests associated with success criteria. These supporting documents are informative, so they’re not normative like the success criteria themselves. That is what you have to meet but these are all – all these supporting documents help you make sure that you meet the requirements. Good. I will take the liberty of answering two more questions and then we’ll move on. One question was when will WCAG 2.2, when will it be released? That was a teaser from you, Carlos, because you mentioned that in your slides. Currently, it’s planned for mid-2021, so mid this year we expect the new version of WCAG 2.2, and hopefully with as many test rules as possible as part of the supporting documents. And then there was another really good question. When can we expect – can we expect the WCAG 3 guidelines to follow the same approach as ACT Rules so WCAG 3 success criteria can be tested more objectively with automation where relevant? This is a really good question because just this – just last week on Thursday, fresh, hot off the press, we, the W3C, published the first public draft of WCAG 3.0. This is still a very, very early draft and we would love your comments. We, of course, want to make WCAG 3.0 more testable and so we want to look at as much approaches, as much carry-over as possible of the ACT Rules. At the same time, WCAG 3 has a very new conformance model. So, they are looking at different ways of evaluating, so not just binary but maybe on a scale. This is maybe a topic for another webinar about WCAG 3.0 but the thing is, yes, we are working closely to try to get – improve the testing in future versions of WCAG.",

So, Jorge, do you want to introduce yourself briefly and then please get started. And you are muted. [Jorge speaking] Sorry. Because the button changed the position of the mic. Let me also put my camera to see me. Okay. Hi, everyone. I'm Jorge Fernandes from the Portuguese Agency, the AMA, Administrative Modernization Agency. We are responsible for the monitorization in Portugal of the web accessibility. We are the body responsible for that. We belong to the Ministry of the Modernization of State and Public Administration. And, well, I'm working in the field of web accessibility since 1999, so in the beginning of the WCAG 1.0. And I'm here to present you the Portuguese observatory. Slide 1: An Observatory to Raise Awareness ... I think I can continue now, Shadi? Okay. In the -- sorry. I will try to get the connection with my slides. Okay. Next one. So in the Portuguese legislation, we have explicitly a method of evaluation mentioned based in the simplified method of the directive. In the preamble of the Implementation Act about monitoring, I underlined these two ideas. The monitoring should raise awareness and encourage learning in Member States, and the overall results of the monitoring activities should be made publicly available. These must involve all entities, all public sector bodies. And the monitoring is not an external exercise to them. So it's something that they need to do it by theirselves. Slide 2: The Directive and PT Trasposition That is one of the reasons why we in Portugal abide the centralized model of evaluation, a method of three steps to each entity evaluate. The simplified method based on automatic and semi-automatic tools. And in that what we call an in depth light is a manual evaluation based on a checklist that we call the ten critical aspects of the functional accessibility, such a kind of W3C Easy Check. And, according to our legislation, this is mandatory, these two references, these two methods of evaluation, and is recommended, also, usability tests with people with disability with a minimum of one task, one users' typology of the European standards, like, you know, the EN 301 549. Slide 3: Simplified Method Based in Evaluation Tools About the simplified method, as you know, in the Implementing Act, the page sample needs to have a number of pages appropriate to the estimated size and complexity of the website. This is the main principle mentioned in the Directive. In the Portuguese proposal, the page sample is composed by the home page plus all pages linked from the home page. From the historical studies in Portugal, we know that this means about 60 pages per website in public administration. Evaluate with automatic tools to WCAG 2.1 AA. And the public sector body can use any kind of tool, but our team will load all the samples in the Portuguese observatory, and all of them is public. Slide 4: Portuguese Evaluation Tools All our tools used same engine, the QualWeb, that already Carlos mentioned. We have the AccessMonitor. That is a tool that produced a web accessibility report of one page. That is also in our website. And the observatory is an awareness tool with global statistics of the entities. If the entity want to know more details, they need MyMonitor. So the observatory don't give the detail of the information -- all information of the sample. To do that, the entities need to have -- to have access to another tool. That is the MyMonitor. So we give them the MyMonitor, and, of course, we include our contact network of people that is working in the field. Slide 5a: Impact of the ACT-Rules So the impact of the ACT Rules in our tools. Until now we change 20 of 80 of our tests based in 13 ACT Rules. Get a more comprehensive analysis, a post processing browser analysis, see more -- at the moment, our tool see more HTML elements. Our tool is also ready to translate to other languages. The output is in EARL and the CSV format. We can output all the results in these two formats. The tools are open source. All the source are in the GitHub. You can find them at the amagovpt.github.io/eed. It is the local where you found the source code. Slide 5b: Impact of the ACT-Rules So the biggest impact of the WAI Tools Project are in the test rules. Just to mention two examples, the headings and the images that we already spoke in this presentation today. Well, talking about the headings, in the past we have headings as traditional H1 to H6. We detect that. Now we detect more headings because we have the traditional ones and the new ones that I mention here has an ARIA-like. We have the attribute role heading in conjunction with the attribute level with 1 to 6 and maybe more headings with more levels. So all of them at the moment are detected by our tool. Slide 5c: Impact of the ACT-Rules About the images, in the past, we only analyzed the alt of the images. Now we have four different attributes where we can put also the alternative text, the ARIA labelledby, the ARIA label, the alt, and also when we use the title alone. Slide 6: QualWeb Engine If you want to try all the ACT Rules that we have at the moment, you can check -- you can check the QualWeb. That is in qualweb.di.fc.ul.pt. So qualweb.di.fc.ul.pt. And there you can try all the 67 -- 67 rules that we have at the moment from the branch of 70. Slide 6: Demo of the Observatory So let's try a demo of the observatory. And now is the moment of David Attenborough. I will put running a video. Let me try. Video in slide playing Let's try a demo of the observatory. The observatory is organized from the big picture until the drill down of one entity. So the first page of the observatory have the big picture. Global score from 1 to 10. Ten is a good practice. Total number of categories, total number of websites, pages, a ranking table of the categories with the number of pages conformed by level. We started by entering the 308 Portuguese municipalities with the sample home page plus all pages linked to the home page. We have more than 50,000 pages introduced at the moment. We have data graphics as histogram of scores and the ten most frequent errors. Let's go now to a category, for example, the category of the municipalities. Second level, the level of category or directory, in this case, the municipalities. The same organization of the first level with the score, the statistical graphics, the total number of websites, the ranking table of entities. Let's see the municipality of Murca. The average score of 9.9, the total number of pages, 243, three pages conform with level A, and 226 pages conform with AAA. It's a good one. Let's see the Murca municipality in detail in the third level. Again, the same organization of data. Histogram, the ten most frequent errors, the top five errors by conformity level, an accessibility plot in a radar graphic. The more full the circumference is, the better. And a table with detailed error distribution. Work in progress. An observatory with more info and with a new look. The evolution of page conformity on the left graphic, the accessibility plot on the right. The histogram of scores. The bad practices, but also the board of good practices with the better practices by WCAG level. And, also, the detailed distribution of all the better practices found. Let's try a demo of the observatory. Slide 7: The Accessibility Statement And now I have also a demonstration of our accessibility statement that is made based on -- in the WAI Tools accessibility statement. We have a crawler to pass through all websites of the public administration, and we can collect information about the conformity level of the -- that is mentioned in the accessibility statement. And our goal is to collect all the information because our accessibility statement is machine readable, so it is possible with a crawler to get this information automatically. And I will show you also what we can also do with the machine-readable reading, for example, an accessibility statement already published and use it to create my accessibility statement. Let's see another demo. Video in slide playing A demo of the Portuguese statement generator. Technically the Portuguese generator is based on the WAI Tools generator. Imagine that you are navigating in the ePortugal, the citizen portal of Portugal. And you want to found the accessibility statement. You know that if you use the suffix \"accessibility\" in the URL, \"acessibilidade\" in Portuguese, it is supposed to find the accessibility statement. And here it is, the accessibility statement, with the references of the analysis done, following the model of the directive and the Portuguese legislation. At the bottom of all statements, we found a link to the generator used to do it. My goal is to create the accessibility statement to my website. I can use the button \"upload by URL.\" I can create my accessibility statement based on the one of ePortugal. I enter the URL of ePortugal statement page, I press OK, and is done. And I have the form with all the data of the ePortugal accessibility statement. Now I change the data according to my organization and website, press the button \"Preview and Download,\" and the statement is already with my data. Well, more or less, because in this demo I only change one field, the name of the organization. Then I press the button \"Download HTML.\" I got the HTML format. Only the structure of the document, not the styles. I copy paste this HTML code to my website. And when I did that, my accessibility statement got the style of my site, and everything is in place. And we got another accessibility statement machine readable, in this case, based on the ePortugal. [Jorge speaking] Okay. So a demo of the Portuguese statement generator again. At the moment, we -- with the crawler, it is possible from data from today we know that we have 32 accessibility statements. We do 16 compliant, eight partially compliant, and eight no compliant is some of the data that it is possible to get automatically from the accessibility statement. Slide 8: Thank you So if you want to see live the Portuguese observatory, you can use the URL observatorio.acessibilidade.gov.pt. So observatorio, O B S E R V A T O R I O. And that's it for my presentation. Thank you very much. [Shadi speaking] Thank you, Jorge. Yeah. So, actually, we have a question right away. The question is -- [Jorge speaking] Don't say. Yes. [Shadi speaking] If we want to install the testing service to our own server, do we need -- oop, and I moved -- do we need the QualWeb core in GitHub only, or what is the purpose of the monitor service, et cetera, repos in ama.gov.pt repos? So this is a bit of a technical question. [Jorge speaking] Yeah. Maybe Carlos can help me. [Shadi speaking] About the installation of this. Somebody wants to use it locally. Carlos? [Carlos speaking] Yeah, sure. I can help, definitely. You don't need to install any QualWeb related service to have the observatory and the tools in the observatory ecosystem working. The monitor server that you mentioned in that question includes the QualWeb core. So everything that requires an accessibility evaluation is handled through the monitor server, which is also tasked with translating the outcomes of QualWeb into the formats that the tools in the PT observatory ecosystem use. So everything that you need to have your own copy of this ecosystem is available from the AMA GitHub repository. [Shadi speaking] Right. So that's one particular aspect is that this entire observatory and all the tools are completely open source, and I'm sure they welcome contributions as well. Now, Jorge, another question was: I don't understand why a new accessibility statement can be made by copying a published -- an existing accessibility statement. Can you please clarify? [Jorge speaking] Yeah. You know, one of the things in the -- when you need to fulfill the accessibility statement is to understand what is in different parts of the statement. So when you can visualize a final declaration already full field, we know that this help also to adapt and to fulfill our own declaration. So it's something that it is helpful to do that, and it is also when you already have the declaration in your website and want to do changes, you need -- you also can use the same method that I used here in the demo to make changes of your own declaration. So it is a question of it's more easier to understand how to fulfill the new declaration and also help to modify our own declaration.",

Text Transcript with Description of Visuals This is video is accompanied by slides 04 Visual Audio [Shadi speaking] Title Slide: Reporting Support Tools For the reporting support tools, I would like to call Eric Velleman from the Accessibility Foundation to come to the virtual stage. Eric, please introduce yourself and take it away from here. [Eric speaking] Okay. So, hi. I'm Eric Velleman. And let me first start up here on my desktop here. So I hope you all see this. That should be it. So I'm Eric Velleman. I'm from the -- I work at the Accessibility Foundation in the Netherlands. We worked on the ACT Rules and on the reporting support tools. So I'll be presenting the two tools that we worked on recently. Both tools are undergoing an update. And in this short -- the two short presentations that will follow now, I'll show you what the updated tools will look like. And probably -- and I hope you can see them soon on the W3C website. Slide 1: Web Accessibility Reporting Tool (1) Okay. So first the WCAG EM Report Tool. So it used to be the -- does everybody see this? [Shadi speaking] Yeah, we see your screen, Eric. [Eric speaking] Okay. Good. So it used to be this left thing here, which is if you still go to the website, you will still see this one. And in the meantime, we've been working on this one, the one on the right. So it's the updated version. Slide 2: Web Accessibility Reporting Tool (2) And to get an overview, it can be found at w3.org/WAI -- W A I -- /eval/reports -- how do you call that small line tool -- forward slash. And what we did is we follow the procedure to evaluate websites in the reporting tool. It helps you generate a report according to WCAG EM. It supports and links to relevant information and tools. It aligns with the WCAG conformant claims. And it supports WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1. It doesn't support WCAG 3 yet. And it can also show the difference between the two. So if you had a previous one in WCAG -- a previous evaluation in WCAG 2.0, you can just add -- just only show the WCAG 2.1 success criteria. Slide 3: Web Accessibility Reporting Tool (3) It is a manual tool, so it doesn't do any automated checks by itself, but it does have the possibility, the new version, to import automated checks. So if you use Axe or Alfa by Siteimprove, you can import the results as long as they comply with the JSON standard for the import. It has the possibility to open and save input, so you can exchange results. So at the end of an evaluation, you can sort of save your evaluation, send it to a friend, and the friend can import the evaluation and continue with it or check it and send it back to you or -- well, in this way you can work with multiple people on an evaluation as long as you don't work on it at the same time. It supports and links to relevant information tools. I think I said that in the previous slide. It's an easy translation file. So it used to be rather complex to translate, but now it's -- it has an easy translation file, so that makes it easy. There is an English file. If you translate everything that is in English to your language, you will have your own language file or your own language version of the reporting tool. It has changed the new WAI design and framework, and it has the possibility of importing data from tools using the EARL format. So now let's shift to the live demo. It should be this one. Yeah. Live demo of Website Accessibility Evaluation Report Generator So this is the live demo of the tool that is currently still on GitHub. And we are working on it, so you will see that you have the same walk through here. So the Overview, Scope, Explore, Sample, Audit, Summary, and View Report are the menu items. And it explains you how the tool works. It gives tips for using it. If you go to it, at the right there's sort of a menu bar. You can view the reports, start a new evaluation, open an evaluation from a JSON file, or import data from automated evaluation tools. So to start a new evaluation, you just click the button, and then you go to the first page, Scope. Well, here you can -- this is not really different from the previous version, only that it also has a WCAG 2.1 and it works a bit better. It has all the parts that were in the previous tools except, of course, the nice part is this one. I should show you the translation file here. So I should push Netherlands. You'll get the Netherlands version of the tool, which is, of course, great. If you want your language there, you just translate the file, and ask somebody at W3C to put it in the right folder. And then all of a sudden, you will have your own language web accessibility evaluation report tool generator. Here, the sample. You can audit the selected sample, which is, like, here with perceivable. You can sort of declare something as passed, failed, cannot tell, not present, or not checked, et cetera, for all the guidelines and success criteria. You can add information for a summary, like the name of the evaluator, the evaluation commissioner, the date, executive summary. And then, finally, you can sort of view the report. Multiple buttons to do that. And it will generate the complete report with all the things that you just input in the previous pages. And on this page is the interesting button. Save the evaluation data as a JSON file. So if you click it, you'll see here at the bottom it saves an evaluation.json. And if you go to the first page, you can then open the evaluation from JSON. I won't do that here because you'll see all the documents on my computer, but trust me, it works. That's the website accessibility report generator live. But, once again, great translation. [Shadi speaking] So you just changed from English to Dutch. Thank you, Eric. So there are already a couple of questions and just some additional visual description. So this is not the final design of how it will look like. It's the kind of tool Eric had read out the URL. And you can find that URL also from the project page and from the agenda, the report tool. We're updating it primarily to support translations more easily, but also to put it in the new WAI style. Many things here is not going to be the final way it looks. It's still a work in progress. And so, yeah -- yeah. There's several questions, Eric, that -- if you can stop moving around because it's distracting me. [Eric speaking] Sorry. [Shadi speaking] Moving content is distracting. [Eric speaking] Oh, sorry. [Shadi speaking] Yeah. So can you clarify the difference between open and importing data? [Eric speaking] Yeah. So open is to open a file. So I just showed you at the end of the evaluation you can save your evaluation report in the form of a JSON file. And somebody else can open your report. So an import, that is to import data from automated tools. So like Axe, for instance. So you can use a tool to evaluate a website, and then the evaluation results can be imported into the WCAG EM Report Tool. The small angle there is that the only thing that will be imported currently are the URLs that are in the sample. So it will choose from all the URLs that you have checked with the automated tools. It will only use the results of the pages that are in your sample at the moment. [Shadi speaking] Excellent. Thank you. And then some more technical questions regarding the underlying data. Somebody is concerned. The underlying JSON data, will it stay the same in the new version? [Eric speaking] Yeah, as far as I know. You know, I'm not sure about that. So you mean if you have JSON data from the previous tool? [Shadi speaking] Yeah. No. The reports you have so far will stay valid. So, yeah, so the functionality, the importing and the opening and closing will be the same, and the JSON format will remain unchanged. Okay. Another question that came also in the -- similar question was on the registration. Can you export -- so we can now export an HTML and in JSON format for machine readable. Are there other formats, for example, pdf or Word or Excel or something? [Eric speaking] No. No. Just HTML as far as I know and JSON. [Shadi speaking] Right. We do have GitHub where you can put wish list requirements or you can open issues. Also, if you find bugs, please do report these, and we will -- yeah, we will see what we can do in the future. But right now, yeah, we do not export to other formats. There was a question: Can you show an example of importing an Axe EARL report? So this was about reporting from -- importing from automated tools. So on -- I think you said you don't want to show the files on your computer, which is fair enough. I think the best we can do is there's -- the EARL GitHub -- and I'll give the URL later to the EARL GitHub. I think it should be linked from the WAI Tools Project page as well, and there -- there should be some sample reports there that you can use from there. Okay. Eric, does the report generator evaluate web or mobile apps? [Eric speaking] Web. [Shadi speaking] And it's WCAG, so it's independent. So, actually, the important thing is this is not an automated tool, so it actually uses all the criteria, so you can use it just as well to create reports for the apps. [Eric speaking] At Accessibility Foundation, we use the same tool to evaluate apps. [Shadi speaking] Right. Good. Good to hear. Wow, there's a whole bunch of questions coming in. We want to move on. When this new version will be released? That's a really good question. Yeah. We hope in the coming week or two. So please hang on. We'll let you know as quickly as possible. At the end of the presentation today, at the end of the session, I'll be giving you information on how you can receive updates, how you can be notified, and so we'll let you know as soon as the new version is available. Another question: Austria and Spain uses the tool from monitoring bodies and make changes. Is there any exchange between your organizations? So, yes, we did actually ask for inputs through GitHub. And I believe we got comments from Austria, I believe, maybe directly, maybe indirectly. And so, yeah, we developed this, you know, openly. Of course, we always love more input so that we can consider any requirements in future versions. Then another question. Would it be easy to add non WCAG criteria to the report generator? For example, other clauses from the EN, from the European standard of the directive. [Eric speaking] Well, I mean, if you have a programmer then I think it would be easy maybe. But it's -- yeah. [Shadi speaking] It's open source. So, yeah, you would be -- yeah. It's -- [Eric speaking] All on GitHub. [Shadi speaking] Not out of the box, but you should be able to adapt the -- okay. And then last question before we move to your next presentation, Eric. We often have multiple analysts working on evaluating a site at the same time. Is there any way to break out of a page for evaluation and upload these results back to the main evaluation so they could work in tandem so that somebody -- I understand the question that somebody evaluates part and then the other evaluates other parts and then we can combine the reports. [Eric speaking] No, not if do you that simultaneously. So if somebody stops evaluating and another takes up, then you can send each other the JSON file, and the other one can continue. But if you -- as far as I know, if you both do the evaluation, you import the file. I'm not quite sure what happens then. So could be that it is added. Hmm. I'll put it on the list of things to check. [Shadi speaking] Right. Yeah. And then information in Germany, we also use the tool and make changes, but we're still at work. So, obviously, using that and making changes to it, yeah, welcome to -- we also welcome translations [Eric speaking] Yep. [Shadi speaking] For all resources that you've talked about. There were some questions on translations that I'll come back to later again in the Q&amp;A. Yeah. So -- oh, and somebody -- at the moment we add an Excel converter. So that's nice to hear that there's something like that. Again, this is an open source project, so you're always welcome to contribute things back into GitHub if you wanted to. There are several issues in GitHub of people asking to have, for example, this collaborative so that multiple people can edit at the same time. We know that this is a feature request, but that's actually quite a project on its own. For now we started really with just this import to allow when you select a sample of pages from your site and you have automated results, you can fill in what the tool knows, but you still need to continue doing the manual part of your work. But it helps combine automated and manual testing. Okay. We're a bit behind schedule, Eric, so please go ahead and continue. [Eric speaking] Tile Slide: Accessibility Statements Okay. Let me get my presentation back. Get you back. Share screen. So there we are. The accessibility statements. Well, this is a shorter story because we did a lot more work on the evaluation tool, and not just adding translation -- the possibility of easy translation there, but also adding a lot of functionality like the imports and like the saving and opening files and to be able to share evaluations. Slide 1: Accessibility Statement Generator (1) So for the accessibility statements generator, it is still the version that you can see live on the W3 website. If you search for statements generator on W3, you'll find it immediately. It's at W3.org/WAI -- W A I -- /planning/statements and slash. Slide 2: Accessibility Statement Generator (2) And there's a page there to generate an accessibility statement with a lot of information on the Preview button, but you still have to fill in everything by hand. So what the generator does is it guides you on providing accessibility statements. It is aligned with the EU Web Accessibility Directive and with WCAG 2 Conformance Claims. It is a manual generator, so this one does not do any automatic checks. But you could link to the evaluation reports or to a JSON file, but you output it from the previous tool. The output is available in both human and machine readable formats. The tool includes examples of statements, guidance, how to make accessibility statements. Most people are, like, what is important for people with disabilities? What would they like to see in a statement like that? And a statements generator tool. It includes input from communities and experts, and it is almost ready for translation to your language because we're still working the last bits of that. So, also, in, like, a week or two, this should be done. And then you could just take one file, translate everything in that file, and you would immediately have your language version of the accessibility statements generator. The only thing that has to be done is that somebody at W3C will then have to put the translated file into a folder. Slide 3: Accessibility Statement Generator (3) So why would you provide an accessibility statement? Well, that is to show users that you care about them and about accessibility, to provide them with valuable help, for CSR reasons, or it may be a requirement, like in Europe for the Directive, for public sector bodies. And what does the tool then do? Well, the tool asks you the questions you need to answer. So it asks you basic information, your efforts, technical information about the accessibility, and regarding the approval and complaints process. It helps create an accessibility statement that can be further customized and branded, et cetera. So you can just save the end result and make your very much most -- more beautiful version out of it. It helps make accessibility statements conformant with the EU Directive. And the output is not for lawyers, but for users of your content. So make sure they understand so they know what to do. That was the idea behind the accessibility statement generator. And the future work is the translations. We're working on it now. And we also looked into the possibility to add your own questions. That was one of the issues. So if you go to the GitHub page, you'll find a lot of proposals there for changes to the accessibility statements generator. We had to prioritize. So besides a few other things, the most important thing was the translations. But all the code is there. So, also, in this case you could take the complete code and add your own questions. And I think in the case of the accessibility statements generator, that would really be a fairly simple thing to do. I think even if you're not really extremely technical you could probably do that. Live demo of Generate an Accessibility Statement Okay. Now for the live demo. Let me go here. So this is the live page on the W3 website. And it's at W3.org/WAI/planning/statements. And then if you go to /generator and then slash -- well, then you will get to this create page, where it asks you basic information like the name of your organization, which could be like this, and then a telephone number or address of your website. That's not a correct one. Over here the standards applied, the conformance status, the additional considerations. Don't send them me. Et cetera. So there's the efforts you did, like organizational measures you took or any other measures, you can add them here. Technical information like the accessibility limitations, compatibility with user environment, et cetera. So it's all -- this is all described in detail. If you show info here, below every header or form fields, there is -- or above every form field, there is more information about what you could fill in there. The technologies used, et cetera. Then somewhere at the bottom you can preview your accessibility statement, and it takes you to your accessibility statement. So I haven't filled in anything, so now it's website name. But if I would go back, let's see here. I will put at least a name in here. Oh, I did put the name in here. Terrible things of life. Okay. Well, here it is. So I probably forgot something. It does the description of the name. So it's a few forms later. So it will generate -- everything that you fill out will be appearing below here. So that is why it is currently very short, but the more information you input, the more information you get in this accessibility statement. That's it. And then above here -- of course, before I say that's it, I should have said somewhere here above you will soon see this translation button where you can get the file, translate it to your language, and then see your own language version of this accessibility statement. Yeah. [Shadi speaking] Thank you, Eric. Yeah. So right on time. We have a couple of questions that I think are a little bit beyond the scope of this project, but they're really good questions. So one question is: I've seen public sector websites publishing accessibility statements only to conform with regulations. In those statements they say that some parts are not accessible. What's the use of having such statements? So, yeah, that's a really good question. And this is one of the reasons why, you know, in addition to the generator, we have guidance, including examples of accessibility statements, to really try to promote good practice. But, yeah, this issue, I guess, of what people do or don't is a little bit beyond our scope. Another question that also Jorge might be interested to weigh in. It was saying: I was interested to learn that in Portugal there's a proposed standard URL pass for accessibility statements. So on a public website if you write \"acessibilidade\" in the URL, you should get the accessibility statement. Are there more countries with such standard locations? Eric, first, are you aware of other countries that have a similar practice? [Eric speaking] Yeah. I know that the Netherlands has a standard location where you can find all the accessibility statements. That is at the toegankelijkheidsverklaring.nl. And you can find enough of you of 2,500 toegankelijkheidsverklaring. And that is also the place -- sometimes they're not even on the website or you can't find them on the website of the public sector body, but you can find them on this website that is hosted by the central government. [Shadi speaking] Jorge, any other thoughts on this? [Jorge speaking] Well, I don't know other countries where they use also the standard URL. But, yes, in Portugal we are using this one. For example, I know that in Italy they centralized the accessibility statement in a website, and you make a link to that website. The accessibility statement is not on the website of the -- of the public sector bodies, so it is outside, centralized in a server managed by the national authority. But I don't know other -- or other examples. [Shadi speaking] Thank you. Yeah. And that goes directly to the next question. Do all countries adopt this statement generator, knowing that some countries in the EU have additional requirements, for example, France and Netherlands? The latter also has its own generator. And then there is the Dutch name, which I cannot read. [Eric speaking] Toegankelijkheidsverklaring.nl. [Shadi speaking] Yeah, be nice to the captioner, Eric. [Eric speaking] Oh, that’s trouble. [Shadi speaking] Having a match. [Eric speaking] Woops. [Shadi speaking] Okay. So we do not -- yeah. We provide this accessibility statement generator as an example as the minimum requirements in the Directive. Also something internationally -- this is not only for Europe, but providing accessibility statements as a best practice internationally. And the expectation is whoever wants can take it, adapt it. So this is why Eric mentioned that you can actually add additional questions, so we try to write the code in such a way that you can extend this basis and also translations so that you can use this separately. So, yeah, it's a tool to help. Some have reused it, like in Portugal. Others have not. And it's totally up to -- you know, to people what they do with it. We did notice -- we did learn from Portugal that the translation was not as easy, and this is why we're redoing that, to support translation. Good. And then somebody re -- put the Dutch URL again. I think somebody wants to have fun with Dutch. Good. Thank you very much, Eric. [Eric speaking] Sorry. [Shadi speaking] Dutch lesson in the next webinar. Let's now move on.",

    "text": "This video information is available: As a Text Transcript with Description of Visuals below On YouTube On a W3C server — video (file format: MP4, file size: 71MB), English captions file (VTT) Audio Description This video does not include audio description because the visuals only support the audio and do not provide additional information. In this case, audio description would be more distracting than useful to most people, including people who cannot see the visuals. The Transcript with Description below includes descriptions of the supporting visuals. Text Transcript with Description of Visuals This is video is accompanied by slides 05 Visual Audio [Carlos speaking] Title Slide: Test Data Browser All right. So as Shadi mentioned, earlier in the project we tried to think of ways that we could use all the data that might come out of tools that implementation rules and other open data formats, and it was one of our goals to propose a prototype that could show how we could browse the large amounts of accessibility testing data that might become available in such a future. Slide 1: Objectives So for this, we tried to look at this from the perspective of someone that's responsible for monitoring efforts, and so we asked ourselves: How can we leverage the support of open data for those monitoring bodies? And we came up with this prototype, and we emphasize this. It is a prototype. It's not something that's production ready, but we developed this as a way to support future explorations of what can such a tool offer. Slide 1: Objectives So let me start by addressing what types of data did we consider for this prototype. So to begin with, we need to get data from somewhere, and we can see there are two sources. First, the accessibility evaluation reports that we have been listening to. So these evaluation reports are written using EARL so that we can import them. So something that's an output of an Axe evaluation and Alfa evaluation or a QualWeb evaluation, all tools that can output their evaluation reports in EARL we could import that to this browser. And, second, all the accessibility statements. We included statements that use the open format, both the one that Eric just presented and that was developed as part of the project, but also the one that we adapted to be used in Portugal. And from both of these sources, we collect an interesting variety of data. So we extract from these sources data on success criteria, on the elements that have been assessed on the ACT Rules that were used to check if the tool uses ACT Rules, the assertions that were made, and the outcomes of those assertions. And so that we can browse this, we have also added the five -- a set of metadata that can be used to categorize and support this evaluation data. So here we can see the continent, country, the category of the website or the mobile app owner. So if it's a private or a public entity, the sector where the entity operates in, and even what evaluation tool it was used to produce the report. Slide 2: Features And we in the tool designed a number of visualizations. So you will be able to see -- we'll do a short demo after the slide. So most data is presented using bar charts with -- that are grouped by the assertions or the success criteria. We -- besides the bar charts, we have a table. We provide access to a table with the equivalent data of the bar charts, but we made an effort so that all the charts are keyboard navigable, and we also include a timeline view so that it's easier to get this grasping of how the different metrics have evolved over time. Live demo of PLACM And I think it's best to illustrate the different ways that we can interact with the demo, with the data, by showing you a demo. So let me switch to new -- a new window. Okay. And so now this is the -- the initial page that you access when you enter this tool. Here we have -- let me start with a disclaimer. All the data that's being presented in this demo was randomly generated, including the name of websites and the evaluation tools, so everything has been randomly generated. And the volume of data that we have here is representative of the number of evaluations that a country the size of Portugal can expect to have in their monitoring process. So as I was saying, this is the initial visualization. You get a chart grouped by pages that have been evaluated over different continents. We start at the continent level. You can include information about the assertions, the passed assertions, the failed assertions, the ones that the tool can't tell if they have passed or failed, the inapplicable ones, and the untested ones. So similar to what Eric just showed previously. You can, instead of showing assertions, show the information based on success criteria. So passed, fail, can't tell, inapplicable, and untested criteria. And let me go back to assertions and move this Zoom window to another place and show you the data table that we have. Basically, the same data that you have in the bar charts can be presented in the tabular format. Okay. So if you want to see data grouped by country, you just pick that on that sidebar. And now that's -- instead of just seeing, okay, like, seeing everything on the sector page, I just want to know information about the two -- the testability of the private and public sectors in the British Indian Ocean territory. So I just select that bar, and I can drill down on sector information on the model window that shows up. And now I have the information about just the British Indian Ocean territory grouped by private sector and public sector, and I can compare that. So if I want to see all data about sectors, I can just press there. And I see, okay, I have over 4,000 pages on the private sector and over 3,000 pages on the public sector. And now let's say I want to compare data of the public sector onto specific countries. So instead of drilling down, I want to group by this -- a way to group this kind of data using another category and, say, okay, let me group this, for instance, France and Luxembourg. Okay. So I can now see the data on public sector bodies only. So we're comparing sector public grouped by two countries, France and Luxembourg. And in this visualization I can have them both at the same time. Let me move to another class. Let me see. We can see tags or categories. Here we have, once again, randomized data. Don't forget if I want to see how health how the health sector has been doing over time, I can just, once again, select this on the bar charts. Sorry. And then I can go and do -- and select the timeline option, which will show me for every month that I have collected data on this -- on websites or mobile apps that have been tagged as health, I can see the data here. Let me go back to tag and show you how I can compare, for instance, data on the health and the media sector. So here I can use the comparison and health, which is the one that I've selected it already. Previously selected. And now I can also select media, and the comparison page will show me, okay, the number of pages that have been evaluated and the passed assertions, failed assertions, can't tell assertions, inapplicable, and untested assertions for both sectors side by side so that I can compare them. Let me just present one more feature. If I go -- this is specific at this level. If I go to the application website and I change my visualization from the assertions to the success criteria, now I can have access to specific tests of each success criteria for one application. So we can see here for the front applications of the fair success criteria, and I'm going to select here this application or website, whatever. And I have this -- it's only in this view that I have this option here, the Details option. So if I go to the Details page, now I have -- okay, for this application or website, I know that passed the success criteria, and I can see the different tests that tell me that, and I see that it failed this success criteria. And, once again, I have access to the different tests where it fails. So we can, in fact, go all the way up from a grouping of the data by continent to specific assertions of one application. So this shows us the range that we can have just by visualizing data that's made available from this -- from these tools. Slide 3: Thank you So let me go back to the slides and just -- I've finished my presentation. So all of this is open source. You can play with this demo. It's available at www.qualweb.di.fc.ul.pt/placm/test. The source code will be really soon available at this rep. It's not there yet because we're moving this to a dedicated repository for this -- for these tools. So you will be able to find it at GitHub.com/carlosapaduarte. That's -- C-A-R-L-O-S-A-P-A-D-U-A-R-T-E /placm. Okay? And if you have any questions or any problems getting this to run, you can get in touch with me at caduarte@campus.ul.pt. And thank you. I think I've gone a little bit over my time. Sorry for that, Shadi. [Shadi speaking] No. You're spot on. Thank you, Carlos. And as I told folks earlier on, this is a bit more aspirational part. So just to recap, we looked at, you know, in the morning of these many, many small rules, right, that test very, very specific parts. And we looked at so called implementation reports for these. So how do we collect information from these different rules and the tools and the methodologies implemented? And then if we can aggregate that on a, say, monitoring body level or, you know, even more widely, can we collect all this data, all this information? I understand this seems a bit more futuristic, but, you know, why not think about that. Public websites are required to be public. The monitoring of their reports is required to happen. If we can provide this open data, we can look more -- and this is not about shaming people. This is about analyzing where are there issues, which particular sectors need more support, need more training and advocation, and, you know, Member States or countries or even organizations. It could be on an organization level could use that to improve their actions and what they're doing to make sure accessibility is implemented. So the key word here is EARL, the evaluation and report language. This is a format to write down test results, basically. I'll read out the GitHub URL for that, where you can go and see that syntax for writing such results. So it's github.com/w3c/earl, E A R L, Evaluation And Report Language. Okay. We had a question for you, Carlos. My master's student is studying the Portuguese public libraries website accessibility. He has full list of public libraries' addresses. Can he import the list to test data browser and do a summary analysis of all of them? [Carlos speaking] No. No. Because this, too, does not do the accessibility evaluation. If you have the accessibility evaluation of all of those libraries in EARL format, as Shadi was just mentioning, yes, then you can import those reports and use this tool to go over and do the -- what kind of analysis that you want to do.",
